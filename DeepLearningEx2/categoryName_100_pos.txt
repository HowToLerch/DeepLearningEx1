Hamlow", "helpful": [62, 65], "reviewText": "Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.

For certain, The Memory Of Trees is melodic, romantic and sensuous. Roma Ryan's lyrics, sung in  Gaelic by Enya (Athair Ar Neamh), float gently like pillow-soft white  clouds. The compositions are relaxing and harmonious (Tea House Moon),  dreamlike and filled with mystery (Once You Had Gold), and include subtle  touches of Celtic tradition (Enya's phrasing on `Hope Has A Place'). The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices. Then again,  perhaps The Memory Of Trees (and all of Enya's work) is so provocatively  ethereal because it is surreal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Have You Hugged A Tree Today?", "unixReviewTime": 959385600, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2000"}

Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.\"The Memory of Trees\" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after \"China Roses\".\"Anywhere Is\" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (\"You go there you're gone forever / I go there I'll lose my way / if we stay here we're not together / Anywhere is\").\"Pax Deorum\" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.\"Athair ar Neamh\" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya's voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.\"From Where I Am\" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.\"China Roses\" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. \"I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me.\" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.\"Hope Has a Place\" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it's very slow, and the beat isn't quite regular. Enya's singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is \"Hope has a place in a lover's heart.\"\"Tea House Moon\" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn't seem typical of Enya's work.\"Once You Had Gold\", 'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,\" with the refrain \"Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.\" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.\"La Sonadora\" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.\"On My Way Home\" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya's singing. \"On my way home / I remember / only good days.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "11 tracks", "unixReviewTime": 1114473600, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2005"}

The Car's debut was NOT on that list.  It was, however, on the Top 10 Debuts We Love To Hate list.  From my standpoint, they were in good company among artist such as Queen, Dire Straits and Boston.  Being a British magazine, Q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wasn't that big in the UK (#29).  My Best Friend's Girl (#3) became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first singles (if not the very first) released as a picture disc (shaped like a car).  Just What I Needed (#17) barely crawled into the top 20 and that was practically it for the Cars until they stroke gold internationally with songs from their Heartbeat City album.In the States this album would hardly be treated similar compilations.  My Best Friend's Girl (#27), Just What I Needed (#35) & Good Times Roll (#41) became radio staples and really much more popular than their Billboard top 100 rankings indicate.  During its release it was still common on late night radio shows to play whole sides.  The three songs already being hits on side A, side B became a popular choice for such occasions.  The album didn't set the charts on fire, barely sneaking in the top 20 (#18).  With continuous airplay of many of the album's tracks sales were consistent, which in the States matters much more than in most other territories.  It wound up being among the top 30 sellers of the decade, selling 6 million copies, an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10.  The Cars, both band and album, thus became huge in the States.There are a few things special about this album.  At the time of its release, 1978, its producer, Roy Thomas Baker, was in huge demand, mainly due to his work with Queen.  With Queen, the production was full of sound effects and bombastic vocalizations (Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example).  The production on The Cars is, however, sparse on most of the album (the intros of My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed are especially good examples).  This made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense.  The texts were filled with Ric Ocasek's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way; along with the late Benjamin Orr's more emotional approach in singing.  In between this sparse production came forceful harmonies, e.g. on You're All I've Got Tonight and Good Times Roll.  Combined, this gave the Cars a punkish feel, what today would be labelled as post-punk rock.  This sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwaves as some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco.Actually, it is remarkable how fresh the music still sounds today, more than 25 years after its release.  Many groups today are basically doing similar things but now it is viewed as being retro.  There is, however, one major drawback on buying this CD (meaning 4 instead of 5 stars).  The sound quality is below par, which becomes more evident listening to their Just What I Needed Anthology.  Despite being 10 years old, the re-mastering job on that release draws forth the sloppy transfer to CD.  The sound is very low although not being muddled as many other badly transferred records.  This album really could use some re-mastering (there is one available, a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc; there have, however, been many albums re-mastered originally released later with clearly audible results so that version does not cut it in my books).  Given the sonic achievements that have been done with old Queen releases (the recent 30th anniversary edition of A Night at the Opera could have been recorded yesterday), this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re-release.  Not only would a re-mastering job be welcome but a hybrid SACD version would have the potential of making these classics fresher than ever.Ric, are you reading this?!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Fine Tuned Debut", "unixReviewTime": 1158537600, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2006"}

This band combined hard guitar-rock with a spacey keyboard-driven New Wave sound (that only then was beginning to emerge) in equal amounts, with straightforward, simple lyrics--and created a sound that was raw yet sleek, edgy but commercially accessible, and totally fresh at that time. Between Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr's similarly cool, unaffected lead vocals, Greg Hawkes' incredibly cool, futuristic keyboards, and Elliot Easton's slicing, awesome guitar-work, this album was truly unique. It influenced countless other New Wave/rock bands afterwards. It has since stood the test of time, and that's what makes it a true classic.When I first heard THE CARS on a cassette tape 22 years ago, I was already quite familiar with &quot;Just What I Needed.&quot; Then, I really got hooked on &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; and &quot;Best Friend's Girl.&quot; It wasn't until 1982 that I really started liking &quot;You're All I've Got Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love.&quot; The following year, I got into &quot;I'm In Touch With Your World.&quot; But it has only been in the past couple of years that I have totally fallen for the medley of &quot;Moving In Stereo/All Mixed Up.&quot; Talk about a true classic; over the years, every now and then, it's given me something new to love about it!

Straddling the line between rock and new wave, the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hits.  \"Just What I Needed\" peaked at #27 and has become a rock radio staple.  The single is my favorite song of all time - it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70s new wave scene.  And it's catchy as hell - I have to turn up the radio whenever I hear it.The second single, \"My Best Friend's Girl,\" went to #35; the song starts with handclaps before a major synth line kicks into gear.  Finally, \"Good Times Roll\" just missed the Top 40, peaking at #41.  However, not a single track is filler - any of them could have been a hit.I was a little too young in 1978 to become a Cars fan, although I caught them in their pop heyday, when \"Drive\" was a major hit.  I've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few years, and I've been blown away by the quality of their music, especially \"The Cars.\"  Propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock-edged guitars to form one of the most distinctive sounds ever.  This CD really demonstrates why the Cars became stars - it still sounds completely amazing.\"The Cars\" sold very well when first released and was certified platinum in late 1978.  Since then, the CD has continued to win fans - with certification for sales of 6 million by 1995.  Every time I hear The Killers or other current retro new wave bands, I want to throw on this CD and hear how it was done right the first time around!

I was, like millions of others, well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorites Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sloop John B. I often planned to purchase this CD, but I never got around to it until a few months ago.After watching VH1's 100 Greatest Rock-and-Roll Albums of All Time, I witnessed that after the votes of many fans and critics  were tallied, Pet Sounds came in at an astounding Number 3, only behind Nirvana's Nevermind and The Beatles' Revolver, and the additional commentaries provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must-have.It is interesting that both The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966. These two works alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top-notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical productions.Lately, as a longtime Beatles fan on one hand and as a person who has come to highly admire the genius of Brian Wilson on the other, I have been comparing Pet Sounds with Revolver. Yes, I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance. However, I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more. Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so.Throughout their careers, the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one. In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain: 1. How successful and well-received would The Beach Boys' Smile, the highly anticipated follow-up that never came to exist, have been? and 2.

Brian's (and Mike Love's) vocals are stunning in their emotional directness. \"God Only Knows\" is quieter, but no less poignant- its dizzying swirls of percussion and dreamy vocal harmonies are just plain hypnotic. \"Sloop John B\" (a cover of a classic folk song) has some great harmonies and an infectious melody. \"Let's Go Away For Awhile\" and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative works on the album. \"You Still Believe In Me\" is a stately, dreamy piece of chamber pop, while \"I'm Waiting For The Day\" is a wonderfully optimistic ballad. \"That's Not Me,\" \"I Know There's An Answer,\" and \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" are fantastic evocations of youthful alienation and angst, while \"Here Today\" and \"Caroline No\" are equally effective portraits of lost innocence and love gone sour.

Even the lyrics have grown past the cars, girls and surfing; intentional or  not, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has deceptively simple verses that double  back on their meaning (&quot;I may not always love you/but long as there  are stars above you/you never need to doubt it/I'll make you so sure about  it...&quot;).  Maybe it doesn't come through just reading it, but that's  about as close to poetry pop music comes in my opinion--the second verse  does the same trick (even better).  Two evocative instrumentals here as  well.  I think it's futile to compare this with &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot;  though many people do--let each rest on their own merits (and remember,  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; came before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;--the Beach Boys'  &quot;rebuttal&quot; was going to be &quot;Smile&quot;, the project that  never made its way to record as a whole).  A lot of people helpfully say,  &quot;If you like so-and-so, then you'll like this&quot;, but I think this  is one of the few records that anyone who loves pop music (or heck, even  &quot;music&quot; in general) should have in their collection.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What is there left to say?

Well, like anyone that age, I assumed he'd be wrong, but one late night years later, I did listen to it.So anyway, he was right, it changed the way I thought about music, at a minimum.  Since then, you might say my obsession with the Beach Boys is complete.The album--  13 tracks of just incredible, lush, essential music.  Much of it is Brian singing lead, and he does so magnificantly, in either a tenor range or falsetto, depending on the piece.  Where there's harmonies, they're sometimes drier than the previous stuff, sometimes as lush and well arranged, and sometimes there's none.As far as the songs go, there's not a bad one-- highlights change for me over time, right now \"You Still Believe in Me\", \"Don't Talk\", and \"God Only Knows\" are my favorites, but this changes over time.  They're all quite brilliant though-- every time I listen to the album, I'm amazed how good it is, from the fragile lead vocal in \"Caroline, No\", the brilliant, layered tag on \"God Only Knows\", the mighty chorus of \"Sloop John B\", there's really not enough room in any one review to say what there is to say about this.This is an album about growing up, about seeking adulthood, it leaves behind the childish themes of the older Beach Boys material that has maligned their reputation for a more mature viewpoint.  If you have a view of the Beach Boys and have not heard this, like I did before I heard it, you're missing out if you don't give this a chance.  I come from a jazz/progressive rock/avant-garde background, and while I had my own impressions of the Beach Boys, I learned how wrong I was.Essential, if you don't own this, you should.

With these two 1965 lps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created. In December 1965 after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles \"Rubbersoul\", a statement album from the fab four, implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit, not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler. Brian was amazed at the simularities between the just released \"Rubbersoul\" and The Beach Boys earlier 1965 releases \"Today\" and \"Summer Days and Summer nights\". Brian would say \"I want to make a record just like that, but I want to make it better!\"Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles. And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history. In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared  to be told to \"go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds\". Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound. An incredible early psychedelic recording released May 16,1966 which influenced the Beatles 1967 Sgt.Pepper so much that George Martin has stated \"if it were'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt. Pepper would not have been created\". Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music. Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and anger.1966 was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time on Aug.5th 1966 the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece \"Revolver\". Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt.Pepper, of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation. The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october 1966 as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece \"Good Vibrations\" just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt. Pepper recording sessions.The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release. Even with the success of Revolver, the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy, and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed  rivals. The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgance, but Pet Sounds  really made the psychedelic  era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper. As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds, if it were'nt for Brians over indulgance in bad habits, will never know. Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique, Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds.Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released, but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien, as their minds were just blown away by it. I listen to both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds  and there is some really eerie simularities, besides the instrumentation between the two, on Pet Sounds after \"Caroline No\" the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes. On Sgt. Pepper you hear barn animals, possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane. Pink Floyd would use animals sounds in their 1970s work, 1970 \"Atom Heart Mother\" including a cow on the cover of the lp. Pink Floyd in 1976 released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show, I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that?Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for 6-8 months to make Sgt. Pepper. To make Sgt. Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Because of this Sgt. Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past, present and future. The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin.John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin vs. Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was on his own and had no real help, even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative, musical skills. The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road. I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson (Tony Asher) as a song writer and music creator. In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era, a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form. I like having both versions of Pet Sounds, Mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono.I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings, but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966. The 5.1 stereo sound is  mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system, you will not beleive Pet Sounds could sound this incredible. Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history. Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era. I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings ever created.This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered. The miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording. Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording.Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s, early 1970s, which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time. If you the reader wish to get more into Pet Sounds you should look into purchasingThe Pet Sounds Sessions. You will with this four cd box set see how genius Brian Wilson constructs his 1966 masterpiece. If Pet sounds Sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release.............................", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "ON 5/16/66 PET SOUNDS STARTED THE PSYCHEDELIC 1960S....THE BEACH BOYS MASTERPIECE,  GOD ONLY KNOWS.................", "unixReviewTime": 1167955200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2007"}

To call it the best pop album ever is an understatement, and also a little misleading. This music is beyond categorization as &quot;pop&quot;-- it's simply brilliant, idiosyncratic MUSIC.

Every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of songs you'll ever hear. It is impossible to overrate Pet Sounds. It is unlike anything that came before or after. Nothing in the Beatles' over-hyped catalog even comes close-- and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to George Martin's production than the &quot;Fab Four&quot;. Remember, Pet Sounds is the work of one singular musical imagination-- Brian uses the Boys as &quot;instruments&quot;-- composed, arranged, produced/assembled, dreamed as a coherent whole.This album should be heard by EVERYONE, whatever you believe your musical to be. It is one of the great works of Western Civilization for us to study, consider and enjoy. Beyond essential.This version offers the original Mono mix as well as a new Stereo mix. Obviously,it should be heard in the original Mono to be fully appreciated, but I'll be the first to admit the Stereo is REALLY good, offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize. It's not a substitute for the original, but a great addendum. Honestly, the best version is the DCC &quot;gold&quot; disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it has an almost intangible like-like quality not even present on the original LP.

I hope that when I eventually die, (no time soon) at my funeral someone will play the soaring, always happy \"E Luxo So\" to send me on my way!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stan and Charlie record first Bossa Nova hit.", "unixReviewTime": 900460800, "reviewTime": "07 15, 1998"}

The best example might be  Union Station's version of (wait for it) the Allman Brothers' \"Midnight Rider\", which as an Allmans fan I like better than the original.  Many of the other songs are written by John Pennell, founder of the band, still a member, and one who can be credited with discovering Krauss' talent as early as five years before this disc was recorded.The personnel of Union Station has morphed throughout the years, and a few of the songs are led vocally by musicians who are no longer in the band.

Even though she was only 23 when she released this CD in 1995, Alison had been recording since she was 16.  Her pure voice shines through, and the songs are consistently excellent; however, three of them are real standouts.\"Baby, Now That I've Found You\" is my favorite selection and simply one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard.  Whenever I hear it, the tune gets imbedded into my mind and plays on a continuous loop for days.  The song was originally a #11 pop hit in 1968 for the Foundations, who are perhaps better known for \"Build Me Up Buttercup.\"  It was only a minor country hit for Alison (#49 in 1995), although it netted her a Grammy for Best Country & Western Vocal Performance - Female.  \"When You Say Nothing At All\" is Alison's biggest country hit, having peaked at #3 in 1995.  What makes its success all the more amazing is that it was a #1 hit just seven years earlier for Keith Whitley.  It's clearly become one of Alison's signature songs.  The final standout for me is \"I Will\" written by those great bluegrass artists - Lennon and McCartney!  Only a tremendous talent like Alison could make a Beatles song into a bluegrass masterpiece.This CD was an unexpected hit - selling more than 2 million copies.  It also helped Alison win 3 major Country Music Association Awards in 1995 - Horizon (best new artist), Female Vocalist, and Single of the Year for \"When You Say Nothing At All.\"  I'm by no means an expert on bluegrass, and I admit that most of the bluegrass CDs I own feature Alison Krauss.

Acoustic Guitars and Banjos and Fiddles were overwhelmed and swallowed up by Electric Guitars and Peddle Steel Guitars.  A successful Bluegrass album sold maybe 30,000.  The &quot;dirty little secret&quot; in Nashville was that the Bluegrass musicians were the ones who could really PLAY, so talented bluegrassers who wanted to make a decent living became Nashville studio musicians.  Bluegrass fans, who are often as fanatical about the music as a religious zealot is about their religion, considered such musicians to have &quot;sold out&quot;, and so it was that artists like Ricky Skaggs, Bill Keith, Marty Stuart and Vince Gill were considered.  Once big fish in the small Bluegrass pond, they were thought by Bluegrass Purists to have compromised their artistic integrity to become Country successes. (Was it ironic that Ricky Skagg's first Country Hit was a &quot;countrified&quot; version of Lester Flatt's &quot;Don't Get Above Your Raisin'?&quot;)The purpose of this review isn't to give even a thumbnail history lesson of the evolution of Bluegrass and a comparison to more popular and &quot;mainstream&quot; forms of music, but it is important in having a complete appreciation of this album to recognize the historical rarity of a &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;breakout&quot; Bluegrass artist or band or recording.  In the past half-century before Alison Krauss the number of Bluegrass recordings which received any degree of popular airplay could be easily counted on one hand:Flatt and Scruggs &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; - the music used as the musical theme to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.Flatt and Scruggs &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot; - the theme to &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;&quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; - from the soundtrack to &quot;Deliverance&quot;&quot;Rocky Top&quot; - by the Osborne Brothers&quot;Fox on the Run&quot; - by the Country GentlemenThen along came Alison Krauss, with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the Bluegrass community while she was still a teenager.She recorded several albums which were among the most well-received in the Bluegrass community leading up to 1995 when her label, Rounder, persuaded her to put together a few new recordings with mostly previous releases, some as &quot;guest star&quot; on other CDs to come up with the compilation &quot;Now That I've Found You&quot;(It may have been called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; for an artist that had HAD a &quot;hit&quot;).That CD stunned everyone, sold 6 million copies and suddenly Alison Krauss was the hottest female voice in Nashville - winning a handful of CMA awards.Under the expectations of THAT success Ms. Krauss and her band, Union Station, went to the studio to record the follow-up album.Many on either side of the &quot;Bluegrass Purist&quot; fence were expecting the next CD to be the &quot;Sell-Out&quot; CD - full of steel guitars and guest duets with Barbra Streisand.What came instead was THIS CD, &quot;So Long So Wrong&quot;, an album that celebrates the Bluegrass heritage that these musicians hail from in addition to showcasing the extraordinary contemporary talents of Alison and Union Station.Newcomers to Bluegrass expecting a recording with nothing but Alison's voice were likely put out a little that some GUY was singing the lead vocal on several of these cuts.  Alison knew that Dan Tyminsky was an extraordinary vocalist YEARS before Dan was chosen to do the singing voiceover for George Clooney in &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot;The CD is one of the prominent ones that Alison jokes about in which her lead vocals are predominantly on beautiful but sorrowful ballads like &quot;Deeper Than Crying&quot; and &quot;Find My Way Back to my Heart.&quot;  These tracks are beautiful and they're NOT &quot;straight bluegrass&quot; for you purists - Ron Block trades in his trusty 5-string for some tasty acoustic guitar work and these are closer to folk or even just &quot;unplugged pop&quot; than to bluegrass.  The Dan Tyminski tracks are rollicking rip-roaring bluegrass monsters like &quot;I'll Remember You, Love in my Prayers&quot; and &quot;The Road is a Lover&quot;.This CD is one of the very best by Alison Krauss and Union Station, and that is saying something.

Martin \"Darkbard\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Bottom-Line: All and all \"So Long, So Wrong\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.Despite the fact that Alison Krauss hasn't the vocal range of most in Country & Western/Blue Grass, she has managed to become the voice of the latter.  Her voice is lithe, but with a charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist; hence her success, mostly with her band Union Station.In 1995 the band Alison Krauss & Union Station (AKUS) released their seventh album \"So Long, So Wrong,\" which went on to garner critical acclaim, but not very much commercial success.  As is the band's style they stayed away from the lavishly produced, pseudo-C&W; Pop that so marks other groups their adopted genre and instead remain fairly close to their Bluegrass roots.  But perhaps the CD was under-produced and engineered if there is such a malady.Most of the album's vocal tracks were too quiet; i.e. it was hard to understand the lyrics throughout most of the CD especially when Ms. Krauss was taking lead.  The especially true on the CD's title track, So Long, So Wrong (track No. 1), wherein Ms. Kruass's already lithe voice is at points inaudible.  The same holds true for track No. 2 No Place To Hide, track No. 3 Deeper Than Crying, but to a lesser extent, track No. 4 I Can Let Go Now, track No. 5 The Road is a Lover, track No. 7 It Doesn't Matter, well you get the picture.  The musicianship was flawless as usual, but the quiet vocal tracks detracted from my overall enjoyment of the CD.That is not to say the entire album is a throwaway because of the vocal shortcomings, far from it.  \"So Long, So Wrong\" maintains the bands tradition of fine musicianship and crisp clear harmonizing vocals (when they can be heard that is) and is overall a worthy AKUS release; just not my favorite.When Krauss isn't spotlighted on center stage, her presence is still apparent in the guise of her high (soprano) harmonies and energetic fiddle.  Her ability to blend into the group, fade into the body as it were, only buttresses the sense that AKUS are indeed a band rather than merely a supporting backdrop for Krauss's solo efforts.  An equaling male vocal cord is struck by guitarist and long time band member Dan Tyminski, who brings more traditional bluegrass sound to the group.  And Ron Block, who is not the strongest (solo) vocalists is an excellent song writer, and contributed two track to the album, track No. 11 Pain of a Troubled Mind (lead vocals) and track No. 14, the hauntingly beautiful There is a Reason.\"So Long, So Wrong\" is an ambitious CD; there are fourteen vocal tracks and one instrumental, track No. 6 Little Liza Jane.  When released the song were included on a two-album set, but only one CD.  All of the members of AKUS play instruments, indeed they are all considered virtuosos.

Adam Steffey has since left the group to be replaced by Jerry Douglas on the dobro.All and all \"So Long, So Wrong\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.

Mike Score does a nice job with the vocals throughout the album.  His voice  is effective and unique.  &quot;D.N.A.&quot; happens to be a very  impressive instrumental.  Paul Reynolds' guitar work on it is really good.  &quot;I Ran&quot; is also a cool and memorable tune.  &quot;Modern Love is  Automatic&quot; has an interesting intro.

The only other BDP record I had before this one was 1987's \"Criminal Minded,\" which is one of the most brilliant, and groundbreaking albums ever made. But I'm beginning to think that KRS-One's sophomore effort \"By All Means Necessary\" is just as influential. The murder of DJ Scott La Rock had a profound effect on KRS-One, which is very apparent in his engrossing lyrical flow. This record feels more personal, and much more concise. And in the eyes of many critics, including myself, this is KRS-One's finest moment.Until now, I never knew that I've heard KRS-One's vocals sampled on so many other hip-hop albums I own. Not only samples, but covered choruses, signature time flows, and of course, the beats. Every emcee has been vastly influenced by KRS-One; underground and mainstream. Check out the first song, \"My Philosophy\". If you're an avid hip-hop listener, you've probably heard these lines sampled many times, \"Right up to your face and diss you\" or \"It's not about a salary, it's all about reality\". Check out that cut-up Deep Purple riff (\"Smoke On The Water\") on \"Ya Slippin\", along with the familiar sample \"Bring it back that old New York rap\". I was also shocked by the chorus on \"Stop The Violence\" - \"1,2,3, The crew is called BDP, and if you want to go to the tip-top, stop the violence in hip-hop, wyahhhh\", or the how about the cover of that chorus by Mos Def & Talib Kweli (Black Star) - \"1,2,3, Mos Def & Talib Kweli, we came to rock it on to the tip-top, best alliance in hip-hop, wyahhhh\". The \"Teacher\" is also in full effect on songs like \"Illegal Business\". The often sampled \"I'm Still No. 1\" is also one of my favorites (It's hard to deny that he's the best). I also enjoyed \"Jimmy\" quite a bit, where we here a reference to one of my personal favorite Jungle Brothers tunes, \"Jimbrowski\".All in all, I'm ashamed that I referred to myself as a hip-hop fan before I got a hold of this record. It's so good it's sick. You can bet that I'll be checking out his solo career after after hearing this example of hip-hop perfection.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Class is in session.

From My Philosophy to Necessary, the record introduced KRS-One as the peaceful Teacher and foreshadowing his gift for contradiction. The album cover may be very familiar to the famous shoot of Malcolm-X with a gun in his hand but songs like Illegal Business, Jimmy and Stop the Violence dropped science on drugs, sex and violence.
