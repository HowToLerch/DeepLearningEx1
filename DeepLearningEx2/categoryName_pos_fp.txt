Martin \"Darkbard\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Bottom-Line: All and all \"So Long, So Wrong\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.Despite the fact that Alison Krauss hasn't the vocal range of most in Country & Western/Blue Grass, she has managed to become the voice of the latter.  Her voice is lithe, but with a charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist; hence her success, mostly with her band Union Station.In 1995 the band Alison Krauss & Union Station (AKUS) released their seventh album \"So Long, So Wrong,\" which went on to garner critical acclaim, but not very much commercial success.  As is the band's style they stayed away from the lavishly produced, pseudo-C&W; Pop that so marks other groups their adopted genre and instead remain fairly close to their Bluegrass roots.  But perhaps the CD was under-produced and engineered if there is such a malady.Most of the album's vocal tracks were too quiet; i.e. it was hard to understand the lyrics throughout most of the CD especially when Ms. Krauss was taking lead.  The especially true on the CD's title track, So Long, So Wrong (track No. 1), wherein Ms. Kruass's already lithe voice is at points inaudible.  The same holds true for track No. 2 No Place To Hide, track No. 3 Deeper Than Crying, but to a lesser extent, track No. 4 I Can Let Go Now, track No. 5 The Road is a Lover, track No. 7 It Doesn't Matter, well you get the picture.  The musicianship was flawless as usual, but the quiet vocal tracks detracted from my overall enjoyment of the CD.That is not to say the entire album is a throwaway because of the vocal shortcomings, far from it.  \"So Long, So Wrong\" maintains the bands tradition of fine musicianship and crisp clear harmonizing vocals (when they can be heard that is) and is overall a worthy AKUS release; just not my favorite.When Krauss isn't spotlighted on center stage, her presence is still apparent in the guise of her high (soprano) harmonies and energetic fiddle.  Her ability to blend into the group, fade into the body as it were, only buttresses the sense that AKUS are indeed a band rather than merely a supporting backdrop for Krauss's solo efforts.  An equaling male vocal cord is struck by guitarist and long time band member Dan Tyminski, who brings more traditional bluegrass sound to the group.  And Ron Block, who is not the strongest (solo) vocalists is an excellent song writer, and contributed two track to the album, track No. 11 Pain of a Troubled Mind (lead vocals) and track No. 14, the hauntingly beautiful There is a Reason.\"So Long, So Wrong\" is an ambitious CD; there are fourteen vocal tracks and one instrumental, track No. 6 Little Liza Jane.  When released the song were included on a two-album set, but only one CD.  All of the members of AKUS play instruments, indeed they are all considered virtuosos.  The circa 1997 group included Alison Krauss (vocals, fiddle, violin), Barry Bales (acoustic bass), Ron Block (banjo, guitar, vocals), Adam Steffey (mandolin), and Dan Tyminski (guitar, mandolin, vocals).  Adam Steffey has since left the group to be replaced by Jerry Douglas on the dobro.All and all \"So Long, So Wrong\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.  The instrumentation on the CD is top notch and more than part of the reason I love this group so much; they have such a passion for Bluegrass and make this quintessential form of American music swell the soul.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not One of My Favorite AKUS Albums, but Still Laudable", "unixReviewTime": 1294531200, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2011"}

These are \"Dance of the Illegal Aliens\" by Percy Jones (who plays bass on tracks 2, 4, 7 & 8), \"Rhesus Perplexus\" by John Giblin (an incredible bassist, who played on the first 3 Peter Gabriel & first two Phil Collins albums, and one of the few good enough to fill in for Percy on tracks 1, 3, 5, & 9 & duet with him on track 7) and the mind-blowing \"And So to F...\" by Phil Collins (his drumming-highness rocket-blasts his incredible sounding & very loud set in all directions on tracks 1,3 & 5-thru-9, monster ex-Herbie-Hancock drummer Mike Clarke, also known today as 'the-most-sampled-drummer-in-hip-hop', filling in for Phil on tracks 2 & 4).The rest of the album is good but these 3 are the tracks where everything clicks and comes together to a level of perfection that just knocks people's socks off into the next dimension. These gems of uber-musicianship and non-compromise that not only succeed but soar into the skies are what have made Brand-X a legendary band, especially in Japan where to this day, 30 years later, they have almost rock-star status. John Goodsall's hyper-speed guitar solos that always tend to seek to raise the intensity of a Brand-X tune a few more notches still above its already wired state into the red without combusting the group fit in perfectly here. The traditionally understated patented Brand-X analog keyboard sounds by Lumely & Robinson provide just the right level of relaxed respite and playfulness to cushion and cool things down in high gear for a while before things torque-up again. \"Rhesus Perplexus\" even shows some Pat Metheny and George Benson influences but a funky, melodic, jazzy track with a louder, thicker drum-and-bass sound and a more odd meter you will search for for a long time and never find. \"And So to F...\" has the distinction of being simultaneously the most accessible tune and one of the most intensely propulsive in the Brand-X universe, using an odd-meter, but with a danceable, hummable rhythm on top that the scorching, fire-breathing, hyper-speed Goodsall guitar solos seem to rip to shreds before it returns again, as Collins, Percy and company give the world a master class in how to play with dynamics and maximum intensity at the same time.\"Product\" was recorded in 1979 and is probably the best-sounding Brand-X album overall as it benefits from the workaholic studio perfectionism that Phil Collins was getting into at the time right after Genesis had their biggest hit until then with \"Follow You, Follow Me.\" The unique drum sound he had perfected on \"Trick of the Tail\" & \"Unorthodox Behaviour,\" sounds even more perfect and refined here and Phil seems to have made sure the engineers got Mike Clarke's sound & Giblin's bass sound recorded as close to his & Percy's sounds as possible also so that the Brand-X experience overall sounds consistent. But to hear all this to best advantage you need to get the 2006 Japanese remaster, not the old 1990 release. There is 16 years of technological improvement there and Japan is where Brand-X truly gets their proper respect. It is definitely worth it for vastly improved sound and you can find it on yab-e for about 15 to 17 bucks.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "MANDATORY album for all fans of Phil Collins' drumming & all fusion & prog-rock fans but get the Japanese Remaster !!!", "unixReviewTime": 1205884800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2008"}

I enjoy listening to this better-than-good greatest hits collection from time to time.  There certainly are some memorable, well-written songs that are included.  Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92) contains a total of 12 tracks--I find every one of the songs to be worthwhile and listenable.  The tunes are taken from three albums:  The Hurting (1983), Songs from the Big Chair (1985), and The Seeds of Love (1989).  Almost all of the songs are in a progressive pop musical direction except for two of them--&quot;Mothers Talk&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; are in a straightforward pop vein.  Undoubtedly, a lot of work has been put into the material that's featured on this album--the songs are intricate, textured, ambient, and inspired.  Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith both do well with the vocals.  Overall, the songwriting is tight, and the musicianship is proficient.  All of the songs feature atmospheric, meaty production.  Also, I like the way keyboards are utilized throughout the disc.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart,&quot; &quot;Head Over Heels,&quot; and &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love.&quot;  &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot; is a charming, melodious song that displays notable singing and a good guitar solo.  I find the tuneful &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; to be an impressive, well-crafted track--the beginning is very nice.  &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot; is one that's elaborate, layered, ambitious, and engaging; it also sports a serene, smooth chorus.  &quot;Shout&quot; is gratifying and memorable, too--I like the urgent-sounding chorus and the catchy guitar solo.  The aspect of &quot;Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)&quot; that I like the most is the ethereal-flavored keyboard playing.  The CD booklet includes the song lyrics.  I find the lyrics to &quot;Mad World&quot; to be interesting.  As for the duration of the CD, it's just under an hour.

Their signature song \"Lovefool\" was distinctive and catchy, and with contemporaries like Smashmouth, Sugar Ray, and Fastball, whose full albums were radically different from their singles, the music consumer should have been wary.  However, I don't think that \"Lovefool\" is necessarily the best song on \"First Band on the Moon.\"  I think that it stands out because, as a single, it received a great deal of production attention.  However, it is not in a radically different style than the rest of the album, and I think that several other songs are just as hooky and clever.  Suspending the bloated expectations presented by \"Lovefool\" reveals a pretty solid and enjoyable album.The Cardigans' sound is pastiched and nostalgic, but at least the styles that they reference are clear.  Overall, there is a strong 70s disco aesthetic, complete with strings, to the proceedings, but with a healthy dose of tounge-in-cheek lounge (i.e. the silly \"Iron Man\" cover).  While the presence of a vibraphone probably appealed to my 90's Twin Peaks fanboy side, infectious songs propel \"First Band on the Moon\" more readily than the specific instruments used.  As an example, check out \"Been It,\" which offers chunky riffs and quiet staccato guitar chords, in contrast to \"Great Divide,\" as it dreamily shimmers with mallets and fender-rhodes.  If I were to point to a weak tune, it would probably be \"Loser,\" which comes off as two songs that did not quite mesh convincingly into one.THE LOWDOWN:  Even today, people may ask if they \"had any other songs.\"  The answer is yes.

Prouse \"Dustyart\"", "helpful": [17, 19], "reviewText": "I once enjoyed the great privilege of having dinner one night at an Albuquerque East Indian restaurant with Michael Pinder, who was, at the time, producing story-CD's for children, narrating them with his rich baritone voice.  His days with The Moody Blues had long been over, and I asked him if he had ever considered returning to the group, should its members invite him back.  He unequivocally said \"no,\" claimed that he held on to no regrets, and was not really interested in looking back so much. As far as I could gather from Pinder's guarded conversation with me and his other guests, there had been a great rift with Justin Hayward, who was becoming increasingly interested in giving the group's music more commercial appeal and in becoming a rock star for whom young women would swoon. Pinder was not at all interested in this direction, and felt that the spiritual center of the group's music was growing smaller and smaller.  It was my delight to be able to tell Michael to his face that one of my favorite Moody Blues songs was his composition from OCTAVE, `One Step Into the Light.\" He seemed glad to hear this. Later, he sent me a reissue of his solo album THE PROMISE, with two bonus tracks, one a fine remake of `One Step...\" Although I won't say that the final nail in the coffin was hammered when Pinder left The Moody's, it seems to me that some of the magic died with his absence. OCTAVE is not a perfect album by any stretch.  One reviewer on these pages labeled `One Step Into The Light' a \"trite\" song and praised `Steppin' In A Slide Zone,' which I think is a tad overblown, so opinions of this record obviously differ, as with any other work of art. Be that as it may, this is the last album that sounded wholly Moody Blues.  It's not that the post-Pinder group didn't try to continue making good music, or evolve in any way, it's just that the times passed them by, I think. Now regarded as even bigger dinosaurs than The Rolling Stones (who, nevertheless, retain some of their former rock credibility), the once-great Moody's keep limping along. I'm still a fan, but I know that their legacy lies suspended in a bygone era. For many rock lovers whom I've spoken to, even their best stuff hasn't aged well (I don't agree, personally), but I am waiting for a time in the not-too-distant future when the distinctive sound of the Moody Blues will be rediscovered by a new generation, and there will be a kind of revival. Even if only a brief revival occurs, this one-of-a-kind band deserves at least that much.

Where their comrades made headlines for their musically artistic, abstractly creative and socially relevant rap, Dres and Mista Lawnge were the Billy Carter to their Jimmy Carter: the sillier and less serious little brothers. Black Sheep's sound is recognizable and artistic; Dres' laidback delivery and Mista Lawnge's spacey beats were distinct even among their headlining mentors. The duo possesses a real charm, and their clever characters and old school B-boyisms evoke a uniquely New York sound that is often funny and brimming with style.However, despite its strengths, \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" does not rank among the Native Tongues classics of the early 90s. Although \"The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)\" is regarded as one of the premier old school hip hop jams, the album is not.The Low End Theoryand3 Feet High and Risingwere timeless pieces of music; in contrast, \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" sounds quite dated. Dres' wit is great, but grows tiresome over 73 minutes of running time, during which multiple tracks sound nearly identical. Part of the dated sound comes in the prevalent subject matter. The majority of the rhymes concern hittin' skins, drinking, partying, and sucker MC bashing. And while Mista Lawnge's beats are never bad, they are frequently uninteresting and similar. They rely heavily on samples, and the looping, bouncy sound is quite subdued, consisting of very sparse production and few instrumentals. The album is structured like an early De La album, with tracks of varying lengths interluded by silly skits. \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" is an enjoyable old school LP, but is bloated and fairly redundant.After an intro, the album opens with the hilarious \"U Mean I'm Not,\" which parodies an Ice Cube song and sets the scene for their blatantly not-hardcore style. Lines like \"Aaahh! Somebody used my toothbrush!\" delivered in a snarling yell are sure to make the listener laugh, before Dres arrives at the realization, \"I dreamed I was...hard.\" \"Butt in the Meantime\" and \"Have U.N.E. Pull\" are both likable old school tracks. \"Strobelite Honey\" is also humorous, concerning women who only look attractive by the strobelite effect. The original mix of \"The Choice Is Yours\" is not as good as the classic mix included later, but still solid. \"To Whom It May Concern\" and \"Similak Child\" are both decent, but \"Try Counting Sheep\" is already familiar. \"Flavor of the Month\" and \"La Menage,\" a sex track, are a bit more memorable. \"Gimme the Finga\" has one of the album's stronger beats, while \"H... We Knows\" is forgettable. \"Black With N.V. (No Vision)\" makes its mark as the sole track with social relevance, and \"Pass the 40\" is a party track featuring a strong posse of Native Tongues rappers. After some more filler, the classic \"The Choice Is Yours (Revisited)\" finally arrives, a classic party cut. This is one of the finest cuts from '91, from the great verses to the glorious \"Engine, engine, number nine...\" break. The album closes with \"Yes,\" which recycles a beat already used earlier.Although the singles created sizable buzz for the duo, by the time they followed up their debut in 1994 withNon-Fiction, they had quietly slipped into obscurity (in 2007, they dropped their third LP,8WM/Novakane, which is suprisingly good). Fans of the Native Tongues sound who already enjoy all of the ATCQ and De La releases should pick this up, aware that it is not on the same level of genius. More casual fans should be satisfied with just the classic singles. \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" is a good album, clever and enjoyable, but it has its share of weaknesses as an LP.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Old school charm", "unixReviewTime": 1203465600, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2008"}

Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\" isn't a classic, but it contains some really good music and should appeal to fans of progressive rock and the Moody Blues. The songs and instrumentals are interwoven with a narration by Richard Burton, and the singers include the Moodies' Justin Hayward (his two songs charted as singles in the U.K., with \"Forever Autumn\" hitting #5), Thin Lizzy's Phil Lynott, and David Essex. There's good guitar work in the instrumentals \"Horsell Common and the Heat Ray\" and \"The Artilleryman and the Fighting Machine\", and \"Artilleryman\" includes an insanely catchy synthesizer theme. Wayne throws in the character of the narrator's fiancee for no reason whatsoever -- except that he had co-written a fantastic lost-love song called \"Forever Autumn\" and it was so good that he needed to find a way to work it into the album. The song here has Burton's narration in the middle of it; if you're looking for the original single mix, you'll need to go to a Moody Blues greatest hits album to find it. The album's biggest downside is that its second half is much weaker than the first; the songs aren't as good, are too long, and have hammy vocal performances.

The Rolling Stone Guide to Rock and Roll  accurately described Fogelberg's work then as a &quot;one-man  CSN.&quot;But if Fogelberg saved his best stories for his finest album,  1981's &quot;The Innocent Age,&quot; he was at his strongest melodically  here.

That's why  Fogelberg's music would hit the bullseye or miss the target  altogether.After the singer-songwriter movement faded, Fogelberg enjoyed  varying success in the 1980s and 1990s trying everything from bluegrass to  world music styles.

The Collector's Edition SBM Gold CD from over a decade ago and this edition sound really close. The new edition wins hands down simply because of the bonus tracks with Lynne's spirited take on Del Shannon's \"Little Town Flirt\", a demo for a track from the album and an unfinished brief (1 minute) for a song that Lynne wrote for the album.While \"Discovery\" is far from ELO's best album it has enough memorable hooks, melodies and songs (and two of Lynne's best singles in \"Don't Let Me Down\" and the funky \"Last Train to London\"). I would disagree with the amazon.com review about \"The Diary of Horace Wimp\" which recalls the grandeur of Lynne's songs and production touches from \"El Dorado\", \"Out of the Blue\" and other winning albums. Lynne was always able to integrate whatever was happening in the music world at the time into his music whether it be prog (the first three ELO albums), concept albums (\"Eldorado\")or new wave (\"Time\", \"Secret Messages\") and make it sound completely natural like an extension of the ELO sound. Here we get one of Lynne's best rockers the new wave influenced \"Don't Bring Me Down\" (sounds like Lynne had been listening to Elvis Costello on this one)While \"Discovery\" may not be the band's best album it finds Lynne generating a number of strong singles and the songwriting is always melodic with imaginative production touches. The inclusion of the remake of Del Shannon's \"Little Town Flirt\" and a rich ballad \"Second Time Around\" with killer harmonies. We also get a demo of \"On the Run\".

Certain genres can be quite wide and open, but others have certain boundaries that one should not step over lest they place their feet in some nasty refuse.  With High Infidelity and its lethal formula of \"naughty,\" sugary pop with a few great hooks and chords passing as rock, boasting one of the most irritating lead vocalists of all time in Kevin Cronin, they most assuredly deserve a place right alongside Triumph as potentially great bands who decided to wander into the minefield of corporate cowpies.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "High Insufferability!", "unixReviewTime": 1325030400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2011"}

The songwriting, musicianship, and  production are quite satisfying and tight.  Cargo is in a pop rock musical  direction, and the album is mostly guitar-oriented--keyboards are only used  sparingly.  There's some good guitar playing throughout the album.  Colin  Hay has a unique and easily recognizable vocal style, also.  Guitarist Ron  Strykert handles the lead vocals on a couple of tracks (&quot;Settle Down  My Boy&quot; and &quot;I Like to&quot;).  There's a total of ten tracks on  Cargo.  Some of the songs that I like are &quot;Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr.  Jive,&quot; &quot;Overkill,&quot; &quot;It's a Mistake,&quot; and  &quot;High Wire.&quot;  &quot;Overkill&quot; is my favorite song.

Featuring a meager dozen tracks this disc does a great disservice to Art Garfunkel himself and to his legion of loyal fans all over America. It is high time that this situation was corrected!\"Garfunkel\" leaves an awful lot to be desired on any number of levels.  First and foremost a mere 12 tracks is simply not acceptable. In this day and age one would expect a minimum of 20 tracks in any collection covering the career of such a significant artist. Next, I would add my voice to that of another reviewer who questioned why an edited down version of Tim Moore's marvelous tune \"Second Avenue\" was included here instead of the full five minute album track.  It is extremely frustrating and I want to pull my hair out every time I hear it!  It just ruins the song entirely.  Finally there is the matter of all that was not included.  I can easily think of at least 8 or 10 tunes that should be a part of any Art Garfunkel collection.  Among the tunes that should have been included is Art's haunting 1974 single release \"Traveling Boy' from his LP \"Angel Claire\".  While this one failed to crack the Billboard Hot 100, Art's vocal performance ranks right up there with \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" which I personally consider to be among the best vocals in pop music over the past half century. Other tunes that might have been included are \"Looking For The Right One' from the LP \"Breakway\" and \"Crying In My Sleep\".  Anyone who has ever attended an Art Garfunkel concert knows of his affinity for doo wop music.  While \"Garfunkel\" does feature his renditions of \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" and \"So Much In Love\" it would have been nice if \"Since I Don't Have You\" was included as well.  And while I am not usually a big fan of \"Live\" albums I might include a couple of numbers from Art's \"Across America\" CD in any new collection as well.It is a mystery to me why Sony has not yet chosen to release a brand new collection of the music of Art Garfunkel.  For now it would appear to me that the 1998 \"import\" release simply entitled \"The Best of Garfunkel\" would be your best bet. But if you take a good look you will find that there are notable omissions on that one as well.  It is high time that Sony stepped up to the plate and corrected this situation.  \"Garfunkel\" as it is presently constituted simply does not measure up.

Haven't looked into Robert Johnson's bio, but I'm assuming that this must be some of the very earliest blues music recorded...it's a lot simpler than more more modern sounding blues...even someone like Muddy Waters. I have to admit that I'd never heard of Robert Johnson before he was referenced in the tv series \"Supernatural\"! A story about Johnson selling his soul to the Devil or something in order to be able to play the guitar well. That reference probably can be attributed to one or two songs featured in this compilation. As for Johnson's guitar playing style, it consists of simple note picking. It can be more elaborate at times too. He also seems to be playing two different note sequences at the same time...one in each hand, it sounds like at times. The tempo is generally laid back. Truth be told, his lyrics can often be hard to understand but when you can make out what he sings, he does have a nice turn of phrase at times. Since there are two cds in this compilation, I think that the one criticism I can make with bite is the fact that alternate versions of songs are sequenced together..often. This is fine if you want to do comparisons, but if you are listening for pleasure, having similar songs played back to back quite often may be an annoyance to some. The sound quality is what you'd expect for recordings this old...lo-fi...often hissy sounding...like a cassette recording...or scratchy...like a second hand vinyl album.The best tracks \"(.)\":They're red hot - quite unlike any other song on this album. A fun song...not sure if you'd call it a rag or not. Johnson has a screechy voice in this song. Maybe it's the kind of song you could imagine Louis Armstrong singing?Then \"[.]\":Walkin' blues - guitar gets a bit funky in this song...sometimes notes are vigorously plucked. Has the lyric \"I've been mistreated. Don't mind dyin'\".Stop breakin' down blues - bit of a classic. Has a \"Hoo-ooh\" vocal...like Little Richard, perhaps.Songs of interest:Beatles related...Kind hearted woman blues - has the Beatle-esque \"Ooh\".  Johnson establishes a rhythm on the bass notes of his guitar whilst sometimes simultaneously playing a melody on the higher strings. He utilises falsetto singing at times.Dead shrimp blues - another Beatle-esque \"Ooh\". Not sure if this song is euphemistic for adultery by a women. Has the lyric \"Someone fishing in my pond\".Me and the devil blues - this may be the song which the tv series drew on to reference Johnson in an episode. Also has the Beatle-esque \"Ooh\". Has lyrical themes of crossroads and voodoo...as mentioned in the tv show.Led Zeppelin related...Traveling riverside blues - has the lyric \"You can squeeze my lemon til the juice runs down my leg. You know what I'm talkin' about\". An example of the nice turn of phrase by Johnson, he also sings \"She got a mortgage on my body now and a lien on my soul\".  Johnson sounds like a bush lawyer there!Elvis Presley related...From four until late - Johnson strikes me as sounding a bit like Elvis in this song (vice versa, of course). I'm thinking gospel singing Elvis...or maybe in something like \"Train\" (if that's the name of the song)  or \"Tiger man\"...had note mentioning \"Wooden heart\", but I think I may have replaced that with \"Tiger man\".Little Richard related...Stop breakin' down blues - \"Hoo-ooh\" reminds me of Little Richard.Billie Holiday related...Sweet home Chicago - Johnson has glassy vocals at times in this song...sort of reminding me of female singer Billie Holiday (I'd say that she was a contemporary of Johnsons, and black too...check out her song \"Strange fruit\"...Billie eschews coded lyrics in this song about the African American experience as experienced by some.Personal lyrics related...Drunken hearted man - this song's lyrics really grabbed me...the early ones, like \"If I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to me\". It sounds really heartfelt. There are two versions of this song on the cd...in one version it is the \"poor mother\", in the second version it is the \"poor father\"...in both versions the father has died...but it seems. Personally, I think it's the living that deserve one's sympathy...it's wasted on the dead.Euphemism related...Stones in my passway - hmm...I'm going to feel silly saying this...but sheesh...is Johnson talking about haemmorrhoids here? In any case, he sings in a different voice here...more measured. Question to myself: who betrayed him?Malted milk - a euphemism for whisky?Milk cow's calf blues - assuming that this song is innuendo...doesn't sound exactly logical to me,  but it is suggestive! Not sure, but I thought that Johnson used the \"n\" word, in the lyric \"Your (?) turnin' blue\". Could be wrong.Phonograph blues - sings of a rusty phonograph needle which doesn't work...I don't think he's actually complaining about his record player...you know what I'm talkin' about?Classic blues elements...I believe I'll dust my broom - has a classic blues shuffle to it...if \"shuffle\" is the right word.  Some parts of this song sound hissy, and other parts sound quite scratchy.Ramblin' on my mind - I could only stomach a little bit of the documentary series on the blues associated with movie director Martin Scorcese \"The blues\". However, I did take away one gem...in blues songs the singer often sung about a harsh mistress. It seems that this was code for slave-owners, in a time where in American slavery was legal, or apartheid was. In other words, the singer would complain about their lover treating them badly, but they were really singing about a cruel slave owner. Just by the by, I couldn't stomach the documentary series because it assumed the viewer was as reverential to the form as the makers were. I had less interest in a documentary series about country and western music, but that series I watched all the way through, because the enthusiasm of the film maker was infectious. I believe that that series was called \"Lost highway: the history of American country\".  Don't think I made it more than 20 minutes into Scorcese's series on the blues. Anyway, this song has that classic blues shuffle and the lyrics \"You treat me so unkind\"...which is what reminded me of that episode on the blues.When you've got a good friend - an example of the classic blues structure...pairs of repeated lines. Johnson plays some complex notes at the start and establishes a pleasant little motif.MIlkcow's calf blues - I made a note for 1:10 - 1:21 minutes into the first version of this song...this may refer to the music having a classic blues element to it. On the second version of this song, the time frame is 1:15 - 1:25.Interesting guitar sounds...Terraplane blues - percussion on the body of the guitar...knocks.If I had possession over judgement day - guitar has a ukelele sound to it.Cross road blues - has more complex guitar playing. Has that cliche clunky blues notes sound at times.  Vocals have a sort of 1950s rock'n'roll style to them.Hell hound on my trail - has a bit where the guitar playing sounds like unskilled doodling...from 0:51 to 0:59 minutes in. This track has a distant sound quality to it...like a phonograph or wax cylinder recording.Milkcow's calf blues - also has percussion near the end of the song (2nd version)...could be Johnson tapping his foot...or the guitar.Linguistic elements/production elements...Love in vain blues - has a news reel type intro...I can make out the following words by the news reader (?): \"I wanna fly _ the ship\" and \"Willie May\". Wikipedia informs me that Willie May was a baseball player. This song is an example of Johnson's guitar playing sound...he's plucking some basic bass notes on his guitar whilst playing a melody on - presumably - the first and second strings of his guitar...I'm not a musician, so am just guessing which strings he is using. UK punk rock band The Clash have a song called \"Train in vain\"...not sure if there is thus a link between these two songs...inspiration?Honeymoon blues - \"You is my destiny\".Come on in my kitchen - Johnson hums the intro. He also has a different quality to his voice here...it's almost a character voice. He also delicately plays his guitar at times.Phonograph blues - the pronoun changes in the second version of this song...from \"she\" to \"I\". This song is a bit jauntier than most of his tracks here.Borrowed melodies etc?...32-20 - sounds sort of familiar to me. Has some interesting notes and melodies on the non-bass strings.Voodoo/Hell related...Cross road blues - might have been the song which prompted the reference in the tv series \"Supernatural\". Has more complex guitar playing here (in the tv series, the legend mentioned was - from memory - that Johnson had sold his soul in order to play the guitar better. That seems borne out in this song! Has some cliche clunky notes sometimes on the guitar too...maybe this wasn't cliche when Johnson was playing it? His vocals here have a sort of 1950s rock and roll style.Preachin' blues (up jumped the devil) - has a jaunty blues lead guitar. Distinctive and recognisable note picking style...on 1st and 2nd strings, perhaps.Hell hound on my trail -Me and the Devil blues - another song which could have prompted the reference in the tv series \"Supernatural\".Recommendations -Muddy Waters - Anthology. I wasn't a huge fan of this album, but if you like Johnson's album, you should like this one too...and vice versa.Muddy Waters - Hard again. Highly recommended. My first exposure to Waters. Unlike \"Anthology\", Muddy goes electric and rock here...has some really thumping drums.

However, this is still a pretty good album, with more than enough reasons to recommend it.  Luther has much more personality as a writer and performer than most artists of this genre, and he knows how to craft a killer track.  The best dance song is easily the majestic medley \"Power Of Love/Love Power\" (#4 Pop, #1 R&B;, #3 Adult Contemporary), which was a monster hit upon release and still holds up as a classic.However, there are a few more techno cuts on this disc that also stand the test of time.  Even if the emphasis is more on style than substance, tracks like \"She Doesn't Mind\" and \"I Can Tell You That\" prove to be irresistible due to their strong hooks and inventive arrangements.  Unfortunately, the by-the-numbers \"Emotional Fire\" is an exception to this rule, and today sounds like relic of the era.  And although the urban radio hit \"The Rush\" (#73 Pop, #6 R&B;) packs a undeniably strong sensual punch, the condensed single edit is actually superior to the overlong album version.With the exception of \"I'm Gonna Start Today\" (which has clever lyrics, but is done in by a rambling melody), all of the ballads on THE POWER OF LOVE are top-notch.  As the earnest \"I Want To Stay The Night\" and the lovely radio hit \"Sometimes It's Only Love\" (#9 R&B;, #9 Adult Contemporary) can attest, Luther has that special gift for writing and performing songs that not only do justice to his amazing vocal abilities, but also manage to be universal without being typical.  Nowhere is this more evident than on the heartfelt smash hit \"Don't Want To Be A Fool\" (#9 Pop, #4 R&B;, #14 Adult Contemporary), which stands as one of his heartbreaking best.Even if some moments of THE POWER OF LOVE don't hold up as well as others, there are so many highlights, most listeners won't care.  Also, though the album doesn't gel into the unified listening experience of his previous recordings, it is so well-made and professional-sounding that it always sounds good while it's on.  And it also has an absolutely terrific finale in the epic reworking of \"I Who Have Nothing,\" on which Martha Wash lends a sizzling duet vocal.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Luther's most dated album, but some great moments still", "unixReviewTime": 1091404800, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2004"}

If my old vinyl copy could talk, I'd be in jail for the rest of my life.  That is, if I could find the damn thing.  And that's a BIG deal, because the remastering of this album completely ruins one of the wildest listening experiences ever created.  On the original album, every tune sounded like it was recorded in different venue with a different producer.  Every mix was completely different, and by objective standards, unbelievably horrible.  By subjective standards, however, the uniquely ridiculous sound of each track made for one of the ten best rock and roll albums ever. \"Search and Destroy\" was all trebled-out, overdriven Stratocasters and virtually no bass, with an up-front metallic clanking throughout that really hurt the ears, even at low volumes (listen to any track on the Mary Chain's Psychocandy to hear roughly what it used to sound like).  Raw Power growled away muddily, with lots more low-end sludge than on this version.  Death Trip sounded just like the name implies, with the lead guitar sounding like it was recorded with the mike about an inch away from the amp, and turned up to 11 with an outrageous treble boost.  Shake Appeal (which fares best on this CD) sounded like it was recorded in muddy mono, until the up-riff ended, and then the power chords exploded in a huge wall of stereo sound, and then shrank back to mono (the effect was mind-boggling at high volume).  But the crown-jewel, the piece-de-resistance, was \"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.\"  If ever a dirtier, sludgier fast rocker was ever recorded (with Iggy's absurd growling-screeching buried behind the wall of unbelievably distorted guitars and bass)I've never heard it.  Just thinking about the way it used to sound after a micro-dot is putting a big smile on my face.  But it doesn't sound anything like that on this remaster, nor does any other track sound remotely as good as on the original (with the possible exception of Shake Appeal, which I preferred in the old mix but which has a lot of power in the new version). And unless you've ever heard the original release, you can't possibly imagine the roll that the right mix can play in turning an excellent album into something that changes your life (not always for the \"better\" in this case). I've been collecting records and CD's compulsively for over 30 years, much to the detriment of floor-space in my domicile, and I've never seen a re-mastering ruin an album the way Raw Power has been eviscerated.  The re-mastering is really loud, but that's not the point.  I've got a volume control to deal with the relatively low levels of the old masters.

{"reviewerID": "A2Y4MUU6R9NDUR", "asin": "B000002AP1", "reviewerName": "Shotgun Method", "helpful": [4, 7], "reviewText": "I have quite a few problems with Raw Power. Plenty of people will tell you that it's a classic and obviously the best Stooges release, but methinks those folks haven't heard the first two (self-titled, Fun House). Moreover, it's not really a Stooges album, per se.Before you slap me for committing an act of sacrilege, it should be noted that Raw Power was recorded with a different lineup over the original Detroit outfit, and 3 years after the awe-inspiring Fun House. The Asheton Brothers are here, but Ron has been regulated to bass, while previous bassist Dave Alexander is nowhere to be seen. That already threatens to rob The Stooges of much of their original charm, since it was Ron's fuzzed-out, wah-wah heavy, wiry 3-chord attack and Dave's thudding basslines that stole the show on the prior two albums (even over Iggy's wild stage act). Speaking of the Ig, he now gets top billing here over his bandmates. Hmmm..Anyway, the new guitarist (James Williamson) totally ruins the new sound. Whereas The Stooges of old was a dirty, primeival boogie machine, Williamson's more technical playing totally throws off the band's garage-rock aesthetic. Less is often more, and Asheton understood that to a T. Also problematic is Iggy, whose vocals no longer effortlessly channel the kind of grimy menace they used to; instead sounding over-the-top, nasal, and affected.Then there's the production. Don Gallucci's mixing job on Fun House was absolutely perfect, with equal amounts murky aggression and brilliant clarity. John Cale's rawer, bargain-basement job on the debut was rough but acceptable. However, neither mix of Raw Power (original Bowie mix and Iggy-supervised remaster) really captures the right sound. Bowie's sounds tepid, too quiet and muddled, but at least it had decent dynamics and was listenable. Iggy's mix sounds truly godawful--the result of cranking everything into the red, it's an undynamic (read: constantly LOUD with no peaks or valleys) sonic mess with overdistortion and digital clipping all over the place. It's just crap, one of the worst remasters I've ever heard.I could forgive some of these flaws if the songwriting was good. Guess what? It's generally underwhelming. Only Search And Destroy (which is the only classic track from this album), Penetration, and I Need Somebody really live up to The Stooges' prior reputation. Gimme Danger sounds like a Doors B-side to my ears, the title track is hamstrung by annoying piano, Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell doesn't live up to its incendiary title, and Death Trip feels overlong and ends in a boring fade-out, thus robbing the album of a powerful exit. Viewed as an Iggy solo album, it's better than most of his post-Lust For Life work, but that's not saying a whole lot.Pick up Fun House and the debut (along with The MC5's Kick Out The Jams and The Monks' Black Monk Time) and help yourselves to some awesome, historical garage-bred rock 'n' roll/proto-punk.

His musical and technical knowledge, however, has always been only basic, forcing him to be dependent on producers for the sonic ambience of his work. His best collaborators include John Simon, who added a fine, murky air to his classic 1968 debut, Songs of Leonard Cohen, and Sharon Robinson, who engineered a gentle, computerized R&B; tone for his excellent 2001 release, Ten New Songs. His worst include Phil Spector, who, in typical form, overglossed and made gaudy every last second of 1979's Death of a Ladies' Man and John Lissauer, who, although not as overambitious as Mr. Spector (Who is?), overproduced much of 1985's Various Positions.Various Positions is often overrun with needless, often annoying, tweaks and trimmings. The two most prevalent irks are Jennifer Warnes' brassy, overdramatic crooning, which drones through the backgrounds of \"If It Be Your Will,\" \"Night Comes On\" and \"The Law\" and the chintzy keyboard and synthesizer treatment that injures \"Coming Back to You\" and \"Hunter's Lullaby\" and all but ruins the lyrically dazzling \"Hallelujah\" (Listen to Jeff Buckley's breath taking, unaccompanied version of this song on his widely acclaimed album, Grace, to hear its true power).There are some instances in which Mr. Lissauer, like Mr. Simon or Ms. Robinson, seems to understand that Mr. Cohen's weighty lyrics and stark, ontarget vocals have their own titanic presences and places the accompaniment fittingly behind the words. \"The Captain\" receives an appropriate, light glaze of the barroom ambience of fiddles and pianos; Mr. Cohen's brave quixotic heart leads a fine, waltzy arrangement through the excellent \"Dance Me to the End of Love\" and, although Ms. Warnes' ostentatious lamenting continues, a gentle sweep of ticking drums and swirling keyboards does much to enhance \"Night Comes On.\" Still, each song contains at least some unnecessary polish.It is an especial shame that these songs have all been somewhat spoiled as they feature Mr. Cohen at his most poignant. \"Coming Back to You\" is his best expression of romantic desperation since \"Bird On a Wire;\" \"Hunter's Lullaby\" is a magnificently cryptic dirge; \"The Captain\" is a sly, easygoing musing about challenge and responsibility; \"Night Comes On\" is a touching, brilliant chronicle of a life cycle that is somehow both mournful and celebratory and \"Hallelujah\" is a inspired eulogy to one man's love and faith.

Although she updates that classic rock sound, the material she is working with rarely rises to the level of the iconic music she so clearly loves.  Sometimes Crow beats musical ideas to death, as in the plodding bass of \"What I Can Do for You,\" the catchy (for the first 20 or so times) but ultimately deadening Stones-like guitar riff of \"Can't Cry Anymore,\" the two-note chorus of \"Run Baby Run,\" or the neverending, simple guitar riff of \"No One Said it Would be Easy\" (a song whose sound of languid guitars with strong echo sounds like an outtake from a Chris Isaak album).  \"I Shall Believe\" drags, and the neo-Disco \"Solidify\" is irritating and has an exceptionally weak melody.That is not to say that Crow's album is without its charms.  I still love the hit, \"All I Wanna Do,\" which manages to take Stealer's Wheel's unforgettable \"Stuck in the Middle With You\" groove and give it a '90s spin that is so infectuously catchy and happy that you can't help but \"wanna have some fun.\"  The percussion, guitars, and strings which slide around chromatic intervals give it an unforgettable charm.\"Strong Enough\" was another superlative song from this album, with a folky, direct sound that reminds me of Jewel's \"Who Will Save Your Soul?\"  Crow comes across as strong yet vulnerable.Much of \"We do What we Can\" has a cheesy, lounge singer sound, with her father doodling around in the background on a muted trumpet.  (Note to Crow: if you want a song to sound like a jazz standard, don't use a drum machine.  Note #2: if you do use a drum machine, at least make it play a swinging rhythm.)  It's only in the brief middle section that the song really takes off and the musicians finally seem to unwind.\"The Na-Na Song,\" with its rapid-fire, one-note stacatto delivery of political semi-nonsense, is basically a musical steal from John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance,\" which stole from a Bob Dylan song whose title I can't remember but that includes the lyric, \"Don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.\"  In fact, this song sounds like something that could have come off of Lennon's Phil Specter-produced album, \"Imagine.\"Crow is not above borrowing from more contemporary sources.  If you can't hear U2's \"One\" when listening to \"What I Can Do For You,\" then pay more attention to the chord progressions.On balance, this is a decent album, but the quality varies greatly from song to song.  Every few months I pop it into my CD player, but I usually keep my hand on the remote control to skip over some of the songs.  If somebody told me that I never could hear this album again, I'd be mildly disappointed but hardly crushed.  Personally, I'd rather just listen to the Eagles, Lennon, the Stones, and the other artists Crow is so influenced by than listen to this second-hand product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "SOME GOOD SONGS, SOME NOT SO GOOD SONGS", "unixReviewTime": 1019865600, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2002"}

One is the sedate and meditative quality of Johnston's voice. It's  appropriate for the more melancholy cuts (This Perfect World, Evie's  Garden), but a less than scintillating instrument for untempo pop (Evie's  Tears, Two Lovers Stop). The second complaint is Butch Vig's production (or  perhaps the analog to digital conversion). The overall sonics of `This  Perfect World' are often dull and lifeless. An example is the rhythm guitar  of `Can't Sink This Town' - it should sparkle like a diamond, but it's  cloudy. And the cymbals on `Across The Avenue' are about as crisp as  one-year old Saltines.

I love his &quot;Ah Um&quot; album on Columbia which came three years later than this one, and recommend it strongly instead of &quot;Pithecanthropus.&quot; In fact, it is the title suite which does not work for me. I find it too dissonant, and a bit boring at 10 minutes-plus. The second tune is a novelty. Several other critics appear to be annoyed by it, but I found it clever and worth hearing more than once. Charles took the Gershwin song &quot;A Foggy Day (in London Town)&quot; and moved it to San  Francisco. He uses the players (himself on bass, two saxophones, piano and drums) to present the original tune beneath a cacophony of urban street and harbor noises, all created with the normal instruments. While the fun of it wears off after three or four hearings, it is artfully accomplished. A brief ballad called &quot;Profile of Jackie&quot; comes next, and at only three minutes, it is the least adventurous and yet most successful piece on the CD. Finally, &quot;Love Chant&quot; takes up nearly 15 minutes, about two-thirds of them great. The person who wants only one or two Mingus samples in his jazz collection should get &quot;Ah Um&quot; first. For diehard fans of Charles, I suppose this is essential. Avant-garde even for today, much less 1956, it is not a record one would put on at a party.

The song is about a woman who is at a concert, and the man performing is singing things that are seemingly directed towards her.

Being an artist who prefers to fully reveal her emotions through her songs , one can be sure she is capable for the best ... and the worst depending on her mood . &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; , her much anticipated following to 1994's &quot; Under The Pink &quot; has been deeply loved by thousands of fans since the day it was released . Even they though , can't help but admitting this is not everybody's thing .The album contains eighteen songs most of them thinly structured . It is not the liquid form of the melodies which is the problem as much as the frustrating character most of them have . &quot; Professional Widow &quot; becomes immediately intense and almost suffocating the minute the vocals walk in . &quot; Blood Roses &quot; is this middle-age...something with no aims or charm what so ever . Things are not getting much better on the more lo-fi tracks . The soft , tender story of suicide victim &quot; Marianne &quot; goes nowhere while &quot; The Doughnut Song &quot; feels long and tirering .Lyrics were always an element which made Amos stand out from other artists of her generation . On her debut &quot; Little Eartquackes &quot; on tracks like &quot; Leather &quot; , &quot; Silent All These Years &quot; and &quot; Precious Things &quot; she wrote some of her best ever , full of metaphors and witty hints . Then on &quot; From The Choirgirl Hotel &quot; , an album shortly released after a failed pregnacy she sounded so touching and vulnerable ( &quot; She's conviced she could hold back a glacier / but she couldn't keep baby alive ... &quot; she sang on &quot; Spark &quot; ) . On this album now , things just don't work that way . &quot; Muhammed My Friend &quot; could be taken as a base for a number of empty philosophical discussions among fans but if there's a piece of music messing with religion out there , this is surely not it . On &quot; Talula &quot; she sings &quot; Talula , Talula / you don't wanna lose her / wrapped in your papoose / your little Fig Newton &quot; . We are supposed to search for something meaningful behind her genious lyrical madness but it's all too confusing . The thing is that Amos doesn't need to get all extreme in order to write good lyrics . She has a rich , sensitive soul and some touching love poetic lines like the ones she wrote on the ultimately beautiful &quot; Your Cloud &quot; from her latest offering &quot; Scarlet's Walk &quot; ( &quot; Do you think just like that you can divide this ? / you as yours / me as mine / to before we were us &quot; ) will simply do .Amos was trying to overcome a rough break up at the time , something the press pointed out in every opportunity yet background information about a singer's life-phase should help complete the potrait of a music album and not trying to support it alone . Music shouldn't be like this , it should be able to  stand autonomus .It's hard to actually reach a single concusion about albums like &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; . This is a record which demands respect not so much for being deeply profound but for being as emotionally charged as it is . Amos has taken gentle music instruments like the pianno and the harpsichord and managed to create stiff , harsh melodies . Only on &quot; Caight A light Sneeze &quot; she delivers the masterpiece we all know she's so capable of : her perfomance is fierce , the bells and backing vocals are totally haunting . Elsewhere though , there's no balance in her songwriting and &quot; Boys For Pele &quot; ends up being more of a challenge for the listener than an actually enjoyable  music offering .", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Passion is present , clarity is not", "unixReviewTime": 1062633600, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2003"}

However, for every song on this album that invokes a deep emotional response there is a song or part of a song that can literally cause me to cringe.The opening of the album is perfect.  Beauty Queen and Horses are both gorgeous songs that pull you in at first listen.  Unfortunately, they are followed by Blood Roses.  I won't say I hate this song, I actually love the music, especially her use of the harpsichord, but her vocals are just all over the place on this one.  I know she's doing it on purpose to portray the anger and agony she's feeling, but when she goes into the \"Come on, come on\"s, her voice breaks in the most wretched way.  It is almost painful to listen to; the comparison in one of the other reviews to a pig is correct, though I can't understand why that would be considered beautiful.Father Lucifer is much smoother; the layered vocals really do give it a charm and sweetness that almost makes up for her howling in the previous song.  Professional Widow was my favorite song on the album when I first started listening to it; now the cacophany of sound is just a bit too much for my nerves to take.  (I must be getting old!)  Mr. Zebra is a short, catchy little nonsense ditty.  I was very pleased to see this one make it onto the Tales from a Librarian collection.  It was a great disappointed though to find that Caught a Light Sneeze was not included in that collection.  This is one of my all-time Tori favorites.  The switching between piano and harpsichord right in the middle of the song is an excellent break and brief mood swing.  The beautiful drum and symbol groove compliment Tori's voice and playing perfectly.  (The same drumbeat is also used in a Delerium song from their album Karma.)Hey, Jupiter, Putting the Damage On,  and Talula are the last of the really great songs on this album, though Marianne, Way Down, Doughnut Song, and Twinkle are also very memorable and well-done tunes.  The rest of the album just kind of sinks into obscurity.  I've listened to this album in its entirety uncountable times and know all the songs by heart.  The one thing that remains clear to me is that  some of Tori's best songs are on this album, but they are nestled in closely with some of her worst.  I can't say I really hate anything about this album (except maybe that part in Blood Roses) but it is very uneven the way it goes from glorious, chill-inducing songs to songs that make your teeth go on edge.I will agree with many others that this is a very daring album and deserves to be listed as a modern classic.  But Tori was in better places before this album and has been to greater places after.  For anyone just getting into Tori, I would have to recommend starting with Little Earthquakes or Under the Pink.  Once you have gotten to know her a little better, then you can try delving into her darker, raunchier, less-polished persona.

Of course set on a course of which music was going through a muck of mire where you had bands like The Yardbirds, Cream, The Troggs, and The Byrds breaking up, and others experiencing revival like Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and Dion, and others going through a transformation like Bob Dylan, The Moody Blues, and The Byrds, and then you mix into all this the ones going backwards like The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles, plus adding new blood to the mix like Blue Cheer, The Chambers Brothers, and Vanilla Fudge not to mention the artists who were still popular, and or up and coming, so it's a interesting time to be a rock and roll star. However, with &quot;Last Time Around&quot; this was the end for Buffalo Springfield. Stills would join up with David Crosby, Neil Young would have a taste of freedom before joining Crosby and Stills at Woodstock, and Richie Furay, and Jim Messina would form Poco, and Messina leaves after 3 albums to join Kenny Loggins. The material here is very diverse, and rooted around soul, country, and blues. &quot;On The Way Home&quot; has a pop flavor which is very unusual for Neil Young, but to me is a very depressing Sunday record as it gives me melancholy of Sundays ending, and rest is almost over, and then back to the grind. &quot;Pretty Girl Why?&quot; is also like &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; a rock and roll suicide. Also depressing, and then there's &quot;I Am A Child&quot; the other contribution of Neil which shows what he would do a few years down the road with the album &quot;Harvest&quot;. &quot;Uno Mundo&quot; has a carribean flavor to the song, and it makes me wonder if they may have spent some time listening to Chris Montez, or Trini Lopez when doing this song. Probably my favorite tune here is Richie Furay's song &quot;Kind Woman&quot;. It's a nice slice of country music. However, with all the diversity, and talent the group would disband on May 5th, 1968.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Oh Let's Just Do This, and Get It Over With", "unixReviewTime": 1090454400, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2004"}

The album itself easily deserves five stars in my book. This is where the original version of \"Landslide\" first appeared, not to mention some of Christine McVie's best songs ever-- her love songs appear upbeat on the surface, but there are darker undertones to her writing on \"Over My Head\" and \"Say You Love Me,\" which makes sense, considering that her marriage to bassist John McVie was about to end.Unfortunately, the sound quality on this remastered edition simply isn't that good. The sound is fuller and there is more low end (bass) than on the original CD, but there isn't enough definition or volume, so the whole thing tends to sound murky. On the original CD release, at least everything was clear and consistent-- I almost think it sounded better that way. I felt the same way listening to the remaster of \"Tusk\"-- it just seems like they didn't go \"all the way\" with the remastering, which is a shame, because these could've been beautiful-sounding discs.

So, my opinion is totally unbiased, and probably won't please the fans.Of many DP's line-up changes, this one (Gillan-Blackmore-Lord-Glover-Paice), known as Mark II, is the strongest. Together they released 4 studio albums in the 70s, that became instant hard-rock classics. This album is the 4th by Mk II, and I'm sorry to say, it is the weakest of them. I don't know what happened. Either they really ran out of ideas, like the other reviewer suggested, or personal problems and the inevitability of their break up casted a shadow on the songwriting, or whatever else, but half of the songs here fail to ignite a spark in me. They sound too generic rockers to my ear. I'm talking about &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; (surprise!), &quot;Super Trooper&quot;, and &quot;Smooth Dancer&quot;. On the other hand, there are some really hitting bluesy rockers, like faster-paced &quot;Rat Bat Blue&quot;, or &quot;Place in the Line&quot;, that shifts from balladry to rock towards its later half.The remastered CD contains bonus tracks, that are fans-oriented. You have remixes of 3 tracks from the original album, that sound a little more sharp, but nothing special, and 2 minute-and-a-half outtakes from studio writing tapes. There's also a new track &quot;Painted Horse&quot;, which doesn't stray very far from the mood of the album. The only thing making sense to me among the bonus-tracks is an excellent 14+ minute studio jam, where the professionalism of the band-members shines.My attitude towards this CD is strange. Half the times I listen to it, I have pleasure, the other half, it bores me to death. Its definite saving grace is phenomenal virtuoso keyboardist Jon Lord, whose performance is excellent to say the least. I'd give a try to ths record just to hear him play!

'Bambi' has a hard rocking crunch and despite some people saying the song is homophobic (which it isn't) it is a really great song.

The material is in a synth pop musical style.  Ten tracks are contained.  The songwriting is satisfying, the musicianship is taut, and the sound quality is worthy.  Morten Harket does not disappoint; he is a talented singer.  The keyboard work is also enjoyable.  The music is atmospheric, stately, and refined.

The dynamic \"The Blood That Moves the Body\" supplies sleek harmony vocals.  The sprightly, fun \"Touchy!\" exhibits smooth falsettos from Harket, a nice bass line, and a pleasing, sudden, in-your-face beginning.  The regal, spirited \"The Living Daylights\" displays pretty keyboard melodies and a memorable refrain.  Another appealing composition is the mournful \"There's Never a Forever Thing,\" with its charming, encompassing keyboard soundscapes and remarkable, expressive singing from Harket.

Scene", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "Fleetwood Mac \"Greatest Hits\" is a collection of 16 songs from the group's peak period.  I would define the \"peak period\" as the five studio albums that the band did once Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were brought into the band.  The addition of Buckingham and Nicks completed the forming of what was the core lineup for the band.(Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood)  and completed Fleetwood Mac's transformation from a blues/rock band to a pop band.  The five albums: \"Fleetwood Mac\" (1975), \"Rumours\" (1977), \"Tusk\" (1979), \"Mirage\" (1982), and \"Tango in the Night\" (1987).  In a lot of ways, this was a culmination of the work done by these four members.  Following the release of \"Tango in the Night\", Lindsey Buckingham - who was a major creative force in Fleetwood Mac would depart the band.  Fleetwood Mac decided to replace Buckingham with 2 new members - vocalist Billy Burnette and guitarist Rick Vito.  So while this may be a culmination of what the core members would do, it also would be an introduction to the next era of Fleetwood Mac as the new lineup contributes two songs.  In addition to these two songs, there are 14 songs from the 5 albums made by the core members.At the time \"Greatest Hits\" was released, Fleetwood Mac had a lot of momentum going.  Following the release of 1982's \"Mirage\" (which still failed to recapture a lot of the magic that 1977's \"Rumours\" had), Fleetwood Mac went on hiatus for 5 years until \"Tango in the Night\" was released.  Once \"Tango\" was released, the band had a lot of momentum going - easily the most since \"Rumours\".  Despite Buckingham's departure, the band continued the momentum from \"Tango\" as they went on a World Tour.  Thus it seemed the perfect time for a greatest hits collection to be released - and the perfect stage to introduce the new members.As mentioned above, \"Greatest Hits\" includes 14 old songs and 2 new songs.  The collection does a decent job at distributing the songs: \"Fleetwood Mac\" has three songs (\"Rhiannon\", \"Say You Love Me\",\"Over My Head\"); \"Rumours\" is represented by the 4 big hits (\"Don't Stop\", \"Go Your Own Way\", \"You Make Loving Fun\", \"Dreams\"); Tusk has 2 songs (\"Tusk\" and an extended version of \"Sara\");  \"Mirage\" has two songs (\"Hold Me\" and \"Gypsy\"); and \"Tango in the Night\" has three songs (\"Everywhere\", \"Little Lies\", \"Big Love\").  The one thing to note is that at the time -this was a pretty good way to get all of Fleetwood Mac's \"hits\" on one CD.  Like many greatest hit collections, they don't often stand the test of time.  This collection is dated.  All of the songs on this collection (including the 2 'new' tracks) are represented on a newer 2 CD collection called \"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\" (the only exception is that \"Big Love\" is done live).  In addition, 13 of the 14 old songs found on this album are represented in the original or alternate versions on the \"The Chain\" boxed set.The new songs aren't bad - they aren't the best songs I've heard Fleetwood Mac do, but they still aren't bad.  One thing that disappoints me is that Fleetwood Mac got very conservative with having two songs sung by Christine McVie (\"As Long as You Follow\") and Stevie Nicks (\"No Questions Asked\").  It would have been nice to introduce Billy Burnette's vocals to the fan base  I heard Burnette sing on the \"Tango\" Tour and while he isn't Lindsey Buckingham, he still has a lot to offer.  \"As Long as You Follow\" is a very average soft song - it fit perfectly in 80s radio.  New Mac member Rick Vito does a nice job on guitar.  I wouldn't buy this CD just to get this song.  I think the better of the two songs is \"No Questions Asked\".  Billy Burnette's background vocals are more prominent in this song. This song is a much more uptempo song - also very much cut in the mold for 80s radio.  I was surprised that this song didn't get a lot of airplay in the U.S.As for the 14 old songs, one thing that I am not happy with is the ordering.  I find that the best \"Greatest Hits\" collections are ones that arrange the songs in chronological order.  This allows me to see how the band progresses over time.  \"Greatest Hits\" shuffles the order up quite a bit.  There doesn't even seem to be any logic to how the songs were arranged.  \"Big Love\" and \"Over My Head\" are the last two old songs before the finale - \"No Questions Asked\".  This isn't the way to wrap up a greatest hits collection.Of course you can make the argument that there are better Fleetwood Mac songs that weren't necessarily \"hits\" that are excluded from this collection.  Most notably missing are tunes such as \"Gold Dust Woman\", \"Seven Wonders\", \"Landslide\", and \"Love in Store\" (all four are included on \"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac set\").  Then again - you still get 16 songs and back in 1988 that was a good number of songs to get on any single disc collection.The liner notes do not include any lyrics for these songs - even the new songs do not have the lyrics included.  I'm also disappointed that they don't list what album each of the songs is from.  There are also no songwriting credits, but the production credits are listed.  There is a nice from Stephen Davis that looks at the band on the eve of a concert from the \"Tango\" tour - but also provides some insight into each of the band members.  While this collection has good music, but it still is pretty dated and you are better off with \"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\".  However, you still may want to get this if you can get this CD at a good price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dated Collection that focuses on \"Hits\"", "unixReviewTime": 1097193600, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2004"}

He has such a grand voice. So often, people blessed with great voices such as his have little or no control of their vocals. Not Tevin Casmpell. He has really good control of his voice and knows when to hit which note. He has an impressive debut LP. The producers (who included Al B. Sure, Qhincy Jones and Prince) did a nice job, even though many of his songs sounds dated. Usually this is a big deterent when trying to enjoy an older album, but it was not a big problem. The sound of this album actually took me back to the time it was released (1991).\"Just Ask Me To\", \"Lil Brother\" and \"She's All That\" all have similar sounds: they all sound very dated. I didn't really enjoy none of these songs, they just sounded like fillers. \"Confused\", on the other hand, is a very nice song. I enjoyed every second of this song. I love the arrangement of the chorus, how the notes fluctuate. Vocally, this song is also wonderful. \"Tell Me What You Want Me to Do\" is another album highlight. This is an excellent song throughout. The production, lyrics, and naturally, the vocals, are all something to remember. Tevin lets his talent simply shine on this song. His falsettos will just make you melt. Tevin has a song on here entitled \"One Song\". This is another impressive number. This song is about how one song can change the world. \"Round and Round\" was produced by musical genius Prince. This song has the typical Prince sound. Anyone who is even remotely familiar with Prince knows that when he produces a song, people will know it simply from the sound. \"Perfect World\" is a cute love song. The chorus is worth mentioning; \"Since I met you, it's such a perfect world...\"I really enjoyed this album.

Yep, that one absolutely bombed and critics panned it to the ground. But, some of the music in that film contained some great music. The soundtrack isn't just a Prince album and it shouldn't be considered that because other artists perfrom here. This soundtrack was an all in all mixed bag. There's much to like here and the styles of music that are presented on this album is half brilliant and half dull. The opening track, \"Can't Stop This Feeling I Got\" is an elegant rock song with uninspired guitar hooks and bumping drum patterns. \"New Power Generation\" is a bumping, new-jack urban track that is one of the best on here. \"Release It\" is a track performed by The Time and it sounds different from anything they previously recorded. It's more of a hip-hop flavored tune, full of loops.  \"The Question of U\" is another great, yet seductive song on this album. On this song, he does some incredible bluesy guitar work. The song is a slow, blues and old-school R&B; ballad with everything you would love in a Prince ballad. \"Elephants And Flowers\" is a fun-based, catchy track with wild, yet funky instrumentation. \"Round And Round\" is a song by the young Tevin Campbell; that is a decent filler track with uninspired synthesizer work and patterned drum sequences. \"We Can Funk\" has Prince doing a steamy collaboration with funk master, George Clinton. The song is so funky and sexy at the same time. \"Joy in Repetition\" is another slow jam on here with Prince doing yet another soaring guitar solo with some airy and soft instrumentation being played in the background. \"Love Machine\" is another pumping funk track by The Time, with Morris Day doing some halirious, yet sexy-influenced raps and Elisa doing the lead vocals. \"Tick, Tick, Bang\" is a flawed attempt for Prince to mix heavy metal, rap, and soul together to create a masterful soundscape. \"Shake\" is a funky-dance number performed by The Time with plastic sounding guitar hooks and keyboard work. \"Thieves in the Temple\" is a haunting tune that has Prince playing yet another earth-shattering guitar solo. It was the only big hit on the album. \"Latest Fashion\" is a humorous and repetitive tune by The Time that serves as filler. \"Melody Cool\" is a wonderfully crafted funk-dance jam that is performed by Mavis Staples. \"Still Would Stand All Time\" is a powerful gospel song that beautifully showcases Prince's spiritual beliefs. \"Graffiti Bridge\" is really an intoxicating \"grand-finale\" ballad that sums up the theme of the album. \"New Power Generation (pt.2)\" is an patchy reprise of the first part of the song, which began the album.The Graffiti Bridge soundtrack is ultimately a mixed bag. Most of the material is just too spiritual and the production is pretty good. But what makes the production so underwhelming is that it does have a strong hip-hop influence. The other artists from the Prince canon does some great, yet inconsistent stuff here as well. Tevin Campbell's \"Round and Round\" and The Time's \"Shake\" and \"The Latest Fashion\" can all be considered as filler that can be skipped over. Some of Prince's set of songs can be considered as filler as well. The flow of the album is just too cluttered because it isn't coherent. For example, after Prince does a song, a Time song pops up, and then another song by Prince comes on. Prince and the other guests that perform on the album tries to tackle as many styles of music they can, but it just gets unsuccessful and jumbled. So, the Graffiti Bridge soundtrack is a 68-minute hit and miss album that does have duds, but you have to skip around it to get to the good stuff.

Even worse than these factors, Elton's sound was becoming consumed by the slick, inorganic electronic trappings of the 1980s' that robbed his recordings of soul and energy.1986's \"Leather Jackets\" is often put neck and neck with 1979's disco disaster \"Victim of Love\" as the absolute nadir of EJ's career, and while it's not quite that bad, it's still worlds away from his best work.At its worst, \"Leather Jackets\" does indeed sink to the depths of the previous decade's low point, with tracks like the title track, \"Go It Alone,\" \"Angeline\" and \"Memory of Love\" being among the most vapid, uninspired tracks of his entire career. Worst of all is the misogynist \"Don't Trust that Woman,\" which he co-wrote with (all of people) Cher, and is notable perhaps for being the only song by a mainstream artist to use the term `ball-buster' in its opening line.However, \"Leather Jackets\" has as many as high points as it does dark spots. \"Hoop of Fire\" is a dark, brooding tale of a love in danger, while \"Gypsy Heart\" burns slowly and seductively. \"Slow Rivers\" is a strong duet with Cliff Richards that deserves more attention to fans. Best of all is the excellent \"Paris,\" in which Bernie Taupin manages to capture the enchantment of the world's most beloved cities in just four minutes by painting a vivid picture of anticipation and excitement as the narrator fantasizes during his flight. And heaven help me, but I love \"Heartache All Over the World\" even though every critical bone in my body tells me it is an objectively awful song, yet it's so fun.\"Leather Jackets\" does not occupy a lofty place in Elton's catalog, and in fact is probably his second worst album.

However, Buffet sounds more inspired than usual, delivering patter worthy of his stage show and maybe even taking a chance or two.The most inspired moments on \"Fruitcakes\" are the title song and an unusual choice of covers. He gives a rant that ends in a Network cast Howard Beale \"I'm mad as Hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore\" that has more to do with not wanting giant cherry sodas at the movie complex before musically diving into politics, religion and \"your tax dollars at work.\" Of course all he really wants is for his pals to all just relax and take it easy.Then there's his reggae-fication of The Grateful Dead's \"Uncle John's Band,\" shape shifting the song from its country folk roots into a loping groove that any Parrothead could love. Then again, I never saw that much light between Deadheads and Parrotheads, which may be why the transition in style works so well.

Davies would have done anything to get back his old life where Buffet makes it just another day at the party.The rest of the tracks are pretty much standard Buffet fare, with love songs to his family (\"Delaney Talks to Statues\"), living the carefree life (\"Lone Palm\") and tongue in cheek shoreline humor (\"Apocalypso\").

If you think I'm crazy, consider this......Yes, this is the same CD that propelled Pebbles to the top of the R&B; ranks in 1987 and 1988 on the strength of the two smash singles \"Girlfriend\" and \"Mercedes Boy\".  But keep in mind those two singles are the EXTENDED versions on this CD, not the original Edit Remix #1 versions on the radio.  So if you're looking for the radio hit versions, you're better off getting \"The Best of Pebbles - Greatest Hits\", which contains not only those two hit singles, but also her #1 smashes \"Giving You the Benefit\" and \"Love Makes Things Happen\" (duet with Babyface) from her follow-up release \"Always\".Aside from the two hit singles, the only other album tracks that stand out are \"Baby Love\" and \"Giving You My Love\" which slows the tempo down for Pebbles to put some emotion into her singing.  The rest of the tracks are very typical 1980's synthesized beat fare.  The songs are not memorable and are no different than those heard on Vanessa Williams or Janet Jackson releases from the 1980's.  On this front, the Pebbles debut CD loses points on originality and production values.  You get the feeling Pebbles and her producers are on cruise control and not really putting all that much into the album tracks.  I do not feel the two hit singles are worth plunking your hard-earned dollars on this CD.  The better deal is her \"The Best of Pebbles\" for sure.Taken on a individual level, the real standout track here is still \"Mercedes Boy\" with the slinky guitar riff riding along with Pebbles cooing vocals.  With her come-on's to the listener \"do you want to ride in my Mercedes...R-i-i-a-a-a-y-y\" it's simply too hard to resist!

Every time that song comes on, you can picture yourself as the driver taken on a slow, long ride with Pebbles in her Mercedes.  Even today, this song is still very memorable for its writing and production.  It's the one song that will always be associated with Pebbles.In closing, I have to say her follow-up CD \"Always\" is superior on many levels, especially the production and quality of songwriting.  Her singing also improves in terms of bringing out the song's emotional core for the listener.  The #1 smash \"Giving You the Benefit\" is still a foot-tapper.  I dare you to keep you foot from moving when that song comes on.  Her duet with Babyface on \"Love Makes Things Happen\" is timeless and played at many weddings.  Its tender vocals will melt the hardest of hearts.  The other album tracks are DA BOMB and there's not a filler throw-away among them.

Guy's self-titled debut is where that sound generated from.  With their hits from this album which included \"I Like\", \"Groove Me\" and \"Piece of My Love\", there is no wonder why this sound became as popular as it did; the public just ate it up.  This album is filled with songs that you can dance to and also resurface a slew of positive memories.  In fact, the vast majority of these numbers are fast in tempo.  Teddy Riley seemed to focus more so on the production of this album than the lyrics.  What makes me say that?  Well, some of the songs don't have many lyrics, but all of the tracks are very experimental (especially for that time, circa 1988).  This album sounds dated from start to finish, but that doesn't necessarily serve as a problem because times do change, and believe me, The \"New Jack\" era had its heyday.There is no filler on this compilation, but there are good songs and there are some songs that exceed good.  \"Spend the Night\" and \"Goodbye Love\" are good at best.  \"Goodbye Love\" is one of the few ballads found here.  Aaron Hall has an incredible singing voice and he shines on every number.  He does well with the lead vocals on \"Goodbye Love.\"  In fact, the other members don't hold a candle to Hall's vocals here or anywhere else on this album.  They knew what they were doing when they made him the lead vocalist.  \"Don't Clap...Just Dance\" and \"You Can Call Me Crazy\" are pretty good moments on the album, but the best songs were definitely released to radio.  My favorite song is \"Piece of My Love\" because I love ballads, this song was not over-produced, and Hall sings the heck out of this song.  The hook is great as well.  \"I Like\" was a huge hit; I can still remember hearing it on the radio constantly.

The bonus live performance of \"For Nobody\" (which could be from a sound board recording but sounds more like it was pulled from a bootleg) isn't included here. It would be nice to see a live album from this period of the band released and based on some comments from Derek Shulman perhaps it will happen (as an archive type limited release). Keep your fingers crossed because while \"The Missing Piece\" isn't \"In a Glass House\", \"Free Hand\" or \"Octopus\", it's still a good album worth exploring.The only way to improve this release would have been to make it a two disc set with a live disc from the same period/some outtakes and/or liner notes on the making of the album.

Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "After years of co-hosting children's show's in her native UK,Lisa Stansfield began her journey into recorded music as a member of the band Blue Zone in the late 80's. Shortly after their breakup she received a solo contract from their label Arista and began working on her debut album. In the final year of the 1980's there was a movement in England,pioneered by individuals such as Terence Trent D'arby,of the Brit soul movement looking to mid-late 70's cinematic disco-era soul/funk/dance records as the main inspiration for their sound. In retrospect you might say it was the early stirrings of what evolved into the neo soul sound over the course of the upcoming decade. For Stansfield here,her key inspirations were very much the style of Barry White with a good dose of Gamble & Huff. On the other hand,her debut album represents to me a creatively interesting twin legacy of the era in which it was recorded.The album begins with her best known song \"All Around The World. It's clear that across that,\"This Is The Right Time\",the title song,\"Poison\" and...almost every other song on the album she favored a sound that was based in slower paced funky rhythm with a lot of string orchestrations and pensive minor chord changes throughout the songs. On \"What Did I Do To You?\",\"The Love In Me\" and to some degree \"Live Together\" you hear the embodiment of the technoish house-disco/soul grooves that basically defined uptempo dance/club records for much of the 1990's and even into the beginning of the next century. \"Lay Me Down\" and the closer \"The Way You Want It\" look to bridge a gap in keeping with a than contemporary variation on the late 70's disco-dance/funk hybrid sound. The biggest stand out is Stansfield's pipes and songwriting; she's a bubbling soul crooner one moment and a throaty funky diva the next, often in the same song. Also her songwriting is both musically and lyrically reflective and romantic.As for the reason why I give this album an atypically middling rating has to do with the instrumentation. I've always been an enormous defender of the electronic nature of music production in the 1980's that irritates the majority of music lovers. Especially when said sound was used in either an organic way or the synthesizers/computers were just allowed to be what they were. To me anyway the overall sound of this album's production suffers from the same syndrome that was very typical of most dance oriented soul/R&B;/funk music of the new jack/house/hip-hop era of the late 80's/early 90's. While the focus is appropriately on the vocals,songwriting and orchestration the music backing her up doesn't fully come into focus. Every song on this album basically attempts to get a Barry White/Philly soul type instrumental sound from electronic keyboards as well as synthesized bass lines and horns that sound totally artificial. In fact,I'd even say sounding like an inexpensive Casio of that era. It has the flavor of music one might hear during 1990-91 on the video monitors shopping for clothes and shoes at the local mall. And for someone with her song writing and often extraordinary vocal abily Stansfield deserved a lot better than that.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Tremendous Talent Locked In The Tumult Of The Times", "unixReviewTime": 1364083200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2013"}

Like every album P and his label put out, it has a handful of great singles and album tracks that are dirty south hip hop at its finest, and it is completely overblown and oversized. The album is nearly 80 minutes long, so naturally as with any No Limit album there is a fair amount of filler to sift through. Guests appear on every song, and mostly they are the New Orleans homegrown No Limit Soldiers, consisting of his brothers C-Murder and Silkk the Shocker, Mia X, Mystikal, Fiend, Mr. Serv-On, Kane & Abel, Mo B. Dick, and O'Dell among others. The subject matter is what Master P gets most heat for, and it consists largely of hustling for money, cars and women, fat blunts, and ghetto prosperity. Production is provided by the Beats By the Pound crew, who did most No Limit production. Their beats are lovably cheap, often utilizing heavy beats and bass with dense horns and synths. Master P and No Limit were obviously not the most original rap crew, so some listeners disparage them for \"biting\" other rap artists' styles, especially on \"Ghetto D.\" These accusations aren't unfounded, but I think they're fun to listen to anyway. For instance, \"I Miss My Homies\" is a great imitation of a song like 2Pac's \"Life Goes On\" or Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's \"Tha Crossroads.\" \"Ghetto D\" certainly isn't perfect, but this album is the reason that No Limit blew up and most of the time it's not hard to see why.This album begins with the title track, a song showcasing the brothers Miller rapping about making and selling crack over a beat jacked from a classic Eric B. & Rakim song. \"Let's Get `Em\" is vintage hardcore No Limit rap, meaning fans will absolutely love it and non-fans will not be able to stand it. The previously mentioned \"I Miss My Homies\" reminisces over lost friends and rappers in a way that many rappers did in '97, personally I like this track. \"We Riders\" is a threatening, gangster track that's a highlight to the album. As the title would indicate, \"Throw `Em Up\" follows the pattern set by the previous track and \"Let's Get `Em.\" I love the song \"Tryin' 2 Do Something,\" a deeper song about relationships with a great soul sample, this song is very well produced and has a great chorus, it's among my favorites on the album. \"Plan B\" is a humorous track with a funny chorus, but the beat isn't special. \"Weed & Money\" is a g-funk kind of track, you can guess pretty easily the subject content from the descriptive title. I don't really like \"Captain Kirk,\" it's okay but not among the better songs on this album. \"Stop Hatin'\" is excellent, a great chorus sung in R&B; fashion slams haters hard and the good raps accompany it, the electronic beat gives the track a deeper feel. \"Eyes on Your Enemies\" is forgettable and very similar to a handful of songs on the disc. \"Make `Em Say Ugh\" is the track that singlehandedly made P and No Limit household names, with its posse-cut feel, banging horn-laden beat, and signature call that had everyone yelling \"Uuuuugggghhh\" for years to come. At this point, the next few songs get kind of similar and generic for about the next twenty minutes, this is a point where I usually keep my finger on the skip button. The last track, however, is a classic and my favorite on the CD, \"Burbons and Lacs.\" This song cleverly samples Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" to make a gorgeous laidback ode to the rich lifestyle of ghetto millionaires. I listen to this song over and over again, the chorus is awesome and the whole song is just really good.Overall I recommend \"Ghetto D\" to fans of entertaining hip hop that's not necessarily lyrical. This was a very influential album and is pretty definitive of the late 90s southern hip hop boom in general. Anyone mildly interested in No Limit or Master P should definitely buy this album, it is the best and most representative of the man and the label. \"Ghetto D\" is obviously no lyrical masterpiece, but it's often fun. This album certainly has its flaws, but if you can overcome most of the filler there are definitely some good songs to be enjoyed.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The archetypical No Limit album...entertaining but inconsistent (3.5/5)", "unixReviewTime": 1165449600, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2006"}

Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of art,' these guys confess to murders on these raps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk mfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police.I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all colors in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this wasn't a joke and these guys weren't Shaft or Superfly. These aren't actors here acting a part in \"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least 2 or 3 of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta rap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more harm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when art that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues.More people got murdered in the inner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than ever ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmul and degenerate attitude no decent or respectable person would or should imitate, it remains a work of art, a very powerful and skillfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta rap,' the reason why this genre of rap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyze it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur?Should S.O.O.Compton be officially censored because it does more harm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to alter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of art are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of art made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasts (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of art which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition.The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings or else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, he did what few people will ever accomplish in their lives, he created a genuine if dangerous work of art. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by his wretchedness.\" If \"Straight Out of Compton\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it or be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumbed-down masses, both black and white, inner city and suburbs, for the worse.The social engineers realized that albums like \"Straight Out of Compton\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a lack of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good art' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, hey, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a lazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the art is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too or beneficial to adopt or else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true art when other methods by Nickelback and L.L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \"loosening of morals' at every ringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta rap' while the art (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, or mountains of completely or mostly harmful product with no redeeming value.Nabokov said that creating a work of art is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \"the strength of street knowledge.\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them. But they were one of the first to prove that 'vulgar elegance,' a seeming contradiction in terms, can be made to exist through art based on their life experience.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Original Low-Life A-Hole Manifesto of the Fine Arts of 24 hour Dou-che-bagism", "unixReviewTime": 1270080000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2010"}

Her rich vocals have a honey-colored tone  all their own, and she skillfully manages to sound emotionally powerful  while maintaining a silky-smooth nuance that makes it all sound effortless.  Unfortunately, the material on hand for her Incognito debut, 1993's  &quot;Tribes Vibes &amp; Scribes,&quot; shows there was still room for  improvement.The most noticeable problem is Leak's lack of elbow room.  She's only featured on five tracks, and while she handles them beautifully  they don't use her talents to their full potential.  The scatted samba  &quot;Colibri&quot; is enjoyable, but the repetitive vocal runs leave Maysa  the chance to do little else but go through the motions.  &quot;Change&quot; is a midtempo delight, featuring lush strings and a  trademark Incognito drum lick behind Leak's masterful vocal, but &quot;I  Love What You Do for Me&quot; is so strikingly similar it's a surprise some  sort of production tooling wasn't attempted.  &quot;River of My  Dreams&quot; gets off to a dreamy a capella start, but ends up robbed at a  length of barely more than a minute.Of course, this wouldn't be as  obvious if the instrumental material were stronger.

Movin' Wes I and II, Matchmaker, Matchmaker -- I could do without those.At the beginning and end of the CD, the arrangements (by Johnny Pate) are more appropriate, the songs are better -- it is four or five star material. Caravan really jumps with big band brass, and I defy anybody to stop their toes from tapping. It is only 2 1/2 minutes, but what a blast! Jule Styne's People is a beautiful slow cut, and Wes makes the most of it. The last four songs are a return to the quality of the first two. Making, as I said, a cheese sandwich.I have nothing against a jazz artist doing a pop record. Is Getz/Gilberto less of a masterpiece simply because it is easy to take, and it sold a zillion copies? Of course not. Wes' later album Tequila is also an excellent easy listening jazz record, but the songs and arrangements are more consistent than Movin' Wes. (I believe Tequila was arranged by Claus Ogerman.)Movin' Wes would have made a good Extended Play album. Skip the middle, and you've got a very nice, but very short record.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3 1/2 stars for this cheese sandwich", "unixReviewTime": 1165622400, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2006"}

She can approximate the highs of the late great Minnie Ripperton and then approach the depths of the late great Sarah Vaughan. On record and especially in concert, Ferrell constantly teases, jousts and whiplashes the audience in the manner of Patti LaBelle, often careering from operatic stateliness to pure pop confection with frequent dips into fire-engine pop-gospel and R&B.; She can also be downright silly.  Still, hers is a distinctive vocal persona that is entirely original.That said, my only problem (and it's a big one) is that in her quest to wow the listener with her vocal range, Rachelle Ferrell often leaves the melodies of her songs behind. Like her great idol Sarah Vaughan (her biggest and most obvious influence), Ferrell seems most interested in reconfiguring and stretching songs well beyond the original intent.  But the difference is that you feel Ferrell's every exertion--she's in a big hurry to prove herself.  Unlike Vaughan or, say, Ella Fitzgerald, whose effortless scat singing seemed to grow organically out of a deeply felt connection between melody and lyric interpretation.  Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald never wore their \"jazz\" credentials on their sleeves because jazz was second-nature to them, something divinely innate.  And, like all the greatest singers (Billy Holliday, the young Aretha, the young Streisand), they sang what they lived.On \"First Instrument,\" Ferrell is superbly backed by the likes of bassist Stanley Clarke, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and other jazz-fusion luminaries who give her lots of room to strut her stuff.  She does some nominal jazz riffing on bluesy versions of the classics \"You Send Me\" and \"You Don't Know What Love Is.\" But some songs (\"Inchworm\") and even some reworked standards (\"Autumn Leaves,\" \"Bye, Bye Blackbird\") venture too far into experimental jazz-fusion territory--a genre that does not really serve her well.Despite all the huffing and puffing, \"With Every Breath I Take\" is in fact the only song here that truly speaks to the level of Ferrell's superb instrument: it's a hauntingly beautiful torch song that allows her to slow down, draw in and caress the listener, thoroughly showing off the stunning colors--and sheer power--of her voice without ever sacrificing emotional intensity (this song is also refreshingly free of the distracting vocal runs that sometimes get in her way). I love a good twist of vocal showmanship as much as anyone else, but I also believe that in music, (like sex and a lot of other great things in life), it's not always what you put out there, but what you withhold that is the most seductive. Unfortunately, the less-is-more concept is something that too often escapes the artist on \"First Instrument.\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Voice Out of This World, but. . .", "unixReviewTime": 1215820800, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2008"}

It was a follow-up album to an absolutely sensational album in \"Hunting High and Low\".  My expectations remained high once I got the CD - it had a beautiful almost \"scandinavian feel\" with shades of blue and green making for a mountain and ocean-like feel.  Not only that as I started playing the first song I was very impressed, but then after that I was completely shocked - the CD becomes a major letdown as there really isn't much that follows this.  The question becomes \"what went wrong\"?The first song is the title track &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;.  The formula is the same as from &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, some great Pl Waaktaar songwriting using the power of lead singer's Morten Harket's voice.  In fact this song is as good as any by a-ha.  The second song is solid as well &quot;The Swing of Things&quot; kind of reminds me of &quot;Train of Thought&quot; from the first album.  But as the album progesses, it is clear to me that this sophomore effort might have been rushed a bit.  The success of the first album might have rushed a follow-up only a year later.  The big problem is that the songs just don't have that &quot;something special&quot; like the first album.  The only other song that is up there is &quot;Maybe Maybe&quot;.  Harket's vocals do soar in this song - the problem is its only a 2 minute song, but this was a Mags song - not a Pl Waaktaar song.  Waaktaar is a much better songwriter.While Morten Harket really did a great job on &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, I don't think Harket could elevate the tracks on &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;. The funny thing is that Alan Tarney is the album's main producer.  Tarney produced the two big hits on &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; which were &quot;Take on Me&quot; and &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; (Tony Mansfield produced the bulk).  Tarney knew what a gem he had in Morten Harket's voice, so I'm questioning a lot of what he was doing with many of the songs on the album.  To me a song like &quot;October&quot; doesn't provide the forum for Harket to use that great voice.  &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; to me seems a bit labored by Morten and the group.  On &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, I also think that Morten could have done much more with his voice.  .  I do like &quot;We're Looking for the Whales&quot; because it was a different type of a-ha song - its a pop song like &quot;Take On Me&quot;, but a little more catchy - but again Harket's dynamic vocals just don't do much here.The liner notes do contain all of the lyrics and all of the credits, so that is a plus.I think die-hard a-ha fans will like this album, but the average fan will probably have this on their shelf more.  I loved &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, but saw a tail off on this album.  By commercial standards this album didn't do well in the U.S. and is probably the reason why a-ha is categorized (unfairly) as a one hit wonder.  If you manage to get this album at a good price, you will be treated to the three good songs I mention above, but otherwise you'll probably overpay for what isn't a great body of work.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Sophmore Jinx in Full Swing Here", "unixReviewTime": 1085270400, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2004"}

Circa 1989 - 90, the alumni of New Edition (including Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant) began a hot streak of solo (and in BBD's case, spinoff-group) hits.  BBD's debut LP Poison was multi-platinum and yielded several substantive chart hits, including at the crossover level.  By working with a combination of hip-hop friendly producers, BBD crafted a hybrid hip-hop/R&B; sound that fit in perfectly with the nascent new jack swing movement in urban music.Hootie Mack attempted to recreate the formula, but with mixed results.  Strangely, none of the original collaborators on the Poison LP (Hank Shocklee, Elliot \"Freeze\" Straite, Timmy Gatling) were found here.  Early lead single \"Gangsta\" (which attempted to build buzz in late '92) failed to make the final cut of the album's 11 songs (cassette purchasers at the time had to settle for 10).  The LP lead-off song here is \"Nickel\", a pro-pot ode that owed something to the then-recent success of folks like Cypress Hill, Redman and Dr. Dre.  The basketball-themed \"Above the Rim\" was a nice up-tempo number, but not quite in \"Poison\" territory.In fact, none of the songs here are.  \"Ghetto Booty\" was a thematic sibling to Sir Mix-a-Lot's \"Baby Got Back\"; \"Straight from the Back\" is a barely-coded paean to Kama Sutra sensibilities.  Not that it makes them bad records, per se, but on the previous album the guys limited the horn-dog carrying on to \"Do Me\".  Unchecked libido is definitely the driving lyrical force on this album.It is perhaps ironic, then, that the biggest hit here ended up being the more subdued-in-comparison ballad \"Something in Your Eyes\" (penned and produced by Babyface.)  It's a touching nod, as is \"The Situation\", which offers the story of a former after-concert \"conquest\" showing up a few years later with child in tow.

Having assembled a quality band for Eclipse he kept basically the same guys that cut that album with him. Everything should of been ready, he was signed to a major, had a worn in band of quality players and could still get himself on the cover of mags like Guitar World etc.Alas this album starts off with an instrumental. I'm all for not sticking to prevailing formulas but what were they thinking? Luckily it's not a bad track. Things pick up with Dragonfly and Teaser which are more normal rockers. Then we get to the crux of the problem - the mid section of the album.I dunno, I was such a one eyed yngwie devotee for so long it still hurts to have to say this - but much of this critically reviled album does indeed suck. Dragged out tunes with production that feels too 'soft' somehow and way too much emphasis on the keyboards. Some fans hated the string sections on this album but I never felt that was such a problem. For me, many of these tunes work in isolation such as No Mercy and Fire and Ice but put in seccession the whole just doesn't gel into a good album.There are some tiny spots of glory for those willing to dig - the slower structures of some of the tracks is something a little new for Yngwie and follows on from slower tunes from Eclipse, the band is quality (Goran Edman has been so great on so many albums) and this album has that rarest of beasts - a Malsteen ballad that works in the form of I'm My Own Enemy, the lyrics of which were written by Goran in relation to his marriage breakdown. And the little instrumental Golden Dawn seques into Final Curtain which is a way cool rocker replete with thunder and rain sound affects.Only for dedicated fans - of which I am one - but my love of the guys music must take 2nd place to my deisre to write honest and genuine reviews.

The material is in a hard rock musical direction.  Overall, I consider the songwriting to be good, the musicianship to be accomplished, and the sound quality to be worthy.  There are 14 tracks; of these 14 tracks, three of them--\"Perpetual,\" \"Leviathan,\" and \"Golden Dawn\"--are instrumentals.  Also, some of the compositions on this album contain a string section.  Malmsteen is a proficient guitar player, while Goran Edman sings smoothly, and the keyboard work of Mats Olausson is skilled.  Songs that I find to be favorites are \"How Many Miles to Babylon,\" \"Cry No More,\" \"C'est la Vie,\" and \"I'm My Own Enemy.\"  The epic, impressive \"How Many Miles to Babylon\" is a stately piece featuring a pretty introductory section consisting of Malmsteen's guitar work, a string section, and flute instrumentation.  The elegant, plaintive \"Cry No More\" displays a beginning that is striking and attractive, nice vocals from Edman, and charming, polished guitar playing from Malmsteen.  The majestic \"C'est la Vie\" presents a regal refrain, gratifying singing from Edman, and sitar work from Malmsteen.  The pleasing, melancholy \"I'm My Own Enemy\" exhibits industrious vocals from Edman.  An example of another track that I like is the fast-paced \"Forever Is a Long Time\"--it sports a remarkable, medieval-sounding ending passage; a string section is also utilized on this song.  The CD insert includes the song lyrics, four color photos of Malmsteen, and another color photo of him and his band.  There is a color photo on the back of the CD jewel case.  The album cover illustration is creative.  The disc is almost 65 minutes.

Okay, I like them, but nobody else does right? Right! So how can this be one of the best late-period Elton John albums? It can't be...But the point is the music in this album is fun, it's the last Elton album to have a considerable amount of umptempo material. And there are some strong songs on here. The ballad 'A Word in Spanish' is fine euro-pop with a great chorus and is emotionally convincing enough. The opener 'A Town of Plenty' is very slight but has a catchy, memorable chorus. 'Heavy Traffic' is a  slightly jazzy, easy going song with some bizarre lyric that I think are about chillin' with mates.A pair of ballads, 'Japanese Hands' and 'Since God Invented Girls' are nothing  special, but they are witty and enjoyable, and since there aren't many ballads on the album, it doesn't feel like overkill. Also the backing vocals are very good on this album, they enhance it.The biggest surprise is 'Poor Cow', a song about a working class American Girl and domestic violence. Elton surprised me by injecting a lot of passion into this one 'You get your dumb man, you see your whole life coming at you from the back of his hand...' he sings it very tenderly. Amazing that he could make a heartfelt song within the confines of Synth-Heavy 80's pop.In fact, all the songs are good and enjoyable. There's not a single one I don't like.

It disturbs me greatly that this album is widely hailed as his best by the general public.  It disturbs me more that the \"real\" hip-hop community has held this album against him ever since its release.  The worst is that I am frequently judged as a member of the first audience by the second because I really feel that Jay is one of the greatest ever and has a great gift.Hard Knock Life is, in my opinion, the highlight of his commercial success.  This album is the breakthrough of Jay-Z to the mainstream and made Jay the commodity that he remains today.  Whether he was able or later is able to move more units than this album does not matter.  He is able to move those units BECAUSE of Hard Knock Life.  Unlike many of the hip-hop community, I do not see this as selling out.  The lyrics of Hard Knock Life remain as ruff, rugged and raw as before.  The beats, while oversimplified perhaps, remain as evenly spread as before with a slight hint of futuristic sounds to them.  But when you hear remakes of \"Hard Knock Life\" on Austin Powers movies or \"Can I Get A...\" as background music on Rush Hour, you have to recognize that any artist is going mainstream.  Congratulations to Jay.So, what is my beef then?  My beef is the overall quality of this offering.  The smartmouthed arrogant Jay that appeared on his prior releases seems like he's just going through the motions here.  Jay is a lyricist, whether he likes it or not, and he just wasn't as clever or witty as I'd come to expect from him.  Also, Jay's intelligence and emotional depth were not here either.  The content seems to merely be an overindulgence in the excessive lifestyle with no particular consequence or concern.  While this may have been a lot of fun for Jay and made a lot of people wish they could be like Jay, it's pretty darn hard to relate to unless you're Donald Trump.  I'm not Donald Trump.Also, the beats were, for the most part, uninteresting.  While the brilliance of the title track is easy to see and quite original in thought, you are also left with songs like \"If I Should Die\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\" that are either overused samples or just flat out boring.  At the time of Hard Knock's release, Swizz Beats was just coming into his own, becoming very popular, and his presence and influence is felt heavily throughout.  As time has revealed, this style becomes played out quickly as it all tends to sound the same, (hence Swizz falling off after repeated Ruff Ryder appearances).The album is not without its good points.  The collabo of longtime partner Jaz-O aka The Jaz on \"Originators\", the wordplay with Memphis Bleek on \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel)\" and the all out lyric fest of \"It's Like That\" are all highly enjoyable.  And even the most ice-grilled hardrock has to have seen the dancefloor at least once when \"Can I Get A...\" came on.Hard Knock Life is not a bad album.  It's probably even a pretty good starting place as your intro to Jay as it's pretty easy to digest.  But when you're ready to move on from the baby food and go after the steak, pick up The Black Album, Reasonable Doubt, or The Blueprint.

This is a feat that many artists don't try, and that a fateful few try and fail at. The result is usually the alienation of many of the fans that allowed you to go ahead making a sophomore album in the first place.SFIJ is full of classic, unappreciated Alanis songs. Its greatest downfall: like every Alanis album, it has a tendency to ramble in places. It was a brave album to make after Jagged Little Pill, but it wasn't exactly better than JLP. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy SFIJ very much, but it tends to overstay its welcome in places and drags. It has enough redeeming moments to make it worth listening to.Front Row - 4/5. This is a weird song. It's one of the easier songs to listen to, but it rambles too much to really keep up with.Baba - 5/5. Critical and fierce. Very much like the Alanis introduced to us in JLP.Thank U - 3/5. Beautiful song that highlights the gentler and more tender Alanis songs.Are You Still Mad - 3/5. An intimate song about the things that can go wrong in a relationship.Sympathetic Character - 5/5. Disturbing and sad. A look at abuse and the complicated relationship between abuser and victim.That I Would Be Good - 1/5. Drags on too long and is hard to follow.The Couch - 3/5. A good story song about a man in therapy. You have to be in the right mood to get into it though.Can't Not - 1/5. In this song, Alanis asks if she is whining. The answer is yes.UR - 5/5. A charming song about the artist.I Was Hoping - 5/5. A conversational song that goes in all different directions, but you just can't not listen to it.One - 2/5. There's not much to this song that you haven't heard before on this album.Would Not Come - 3/5. Hard to listen to, but too fascinating not to. More self deprecation.Unsent - 5/5. A sweet look at the men in Alanis' life and how they shaped her. Think along the lines of Head Over Feet but about multiple people, and if they had broken up.So Pure - 4/5. This song is short but satisfying. Optimistic and cute.Joining You - 5/5. Heart-wrenching song about a suicide and the best friend touched by it.Heart of the House - 3/5. Sad song about the relationship between a mother and daughter.Your Congratulations - 2/5. Slow album closer.

Moreover, Alanis goes for a sustained  stream-of-consciousness, using the songs as vignettes of her spiritual  growth in the years since Jagged Little People.  This is clearly an  emotionally diverse, introspective album.But, I think her choice  to essentially place journal entries into song makes the songs hard to take  in.  Dense but lacking real wit or power, her writings seem more like  &quot;straight-from-the-tape&quot; couch rants than really insightful  verse.  With the amazing verbiage, there's barely enough here for a proper  verse-chorus-verse song.  It seems at times that the songs seem stretched  out just for her not-very-good lyrics.  It goes beyond confessional to  being merely self-indulgenet and a rather bombastic, lazy attempt at  &quot;meaningful&quot; lyrics.So, ironically considering her  obvious growth as an artist, the best songs here are the ones most like  those on Jagged Little People.  Simpler, less produced, and to the  point.The best way to listen to this album, like listening to a  person go on and on about their lives, is sorta tune out and catch the gist  of their saying.

And it's a sure bet that  nobody would be talking about her if she weren't a S-T-A-R. &quot;Every Day  is a New Day,&quot; Ross' latest release, is her first studio-length album  since 1995's &quot;Take Me Higher.&quot; Although it maintains that album's  fine production values, and Ross' voice is lovely as ever, this current  offering is marred by pleasant but unmemorable material. &quot;He Lives in  You&quot; is a promising beginning--a robust, African arrangement and a  rousing vocal from Ross create one of her more exciting tracks of recent  memory. &quot;Love is All That Matters,&quot; the much-ballyhooed  centerpiece of the Ross &amp; Brandy telefilm, &quot;Double Platinum,&quot;  is typical of songwriter Diane Warren's previous work: sappy, generic, and  very listenable. &quot;Until We Meet Again,&quot; with an excellent, Latin  guitar-augmented arrangement, is probably Ross' strongest ballad  performance on the album. She conveys a real sense of hurt and longing, and  sings as if it were 1971 all over again. &quot;Got to Be Free&quot; and  &quot;Not Over You Yet&quot; are both solid, goodtime R&amp;B grooves, but  the formula wears thin for the lesser songs, &quot;So They Say&quot; and  &quot;Sugarfree.&quot; The title track, sandwiched between these four  songs, suffers from being lost in the shuffle--it's sparse beat and  bittersweet lyrics are very affecting. &quot;Someone That You Loved  Before&quot; is a throwback to Ross' lush work with Michael Masser  (&quot;It's My Turn,&quot; &quot;Theme from Mahogany&quot;), and is another  standout track. Ross' fondness for &quot;inspirational&quot; tunes has not  abated, and &quot;Hope is an Open Window&quot; continues her  reach-out-and-touch-love-can-conquer-all vibe. Luckily, the song itself is  strong, although Ross is almost dwarfed by the gospel choir backing her.  The fiery dance track &quot;Carry On&quot; jolts the listener after all the  previous balladry and R&amp;B shuffles--growling from her gut, Ross bravely  tackles this Martha Wash club classic, and comes out a winner. Like her  unexpectedly excellent cover of &quot;I Will Survive&quot; (from &quot;Take  Me Higher&quot;), Ross surprises with her ability to make the material her  own. Indeed, Ross continues to sound as good as ever on her recordings; if  only the material could consistently catch up with her.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ross in Fine Voice; Needs Stronger Material", "unixReviewTime": 955411200, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2000"}

In short, there are all the tell tale signs of loud mastering (see \"loudness war\" at wikipedia).  For those that don't know, most pop rock offerings today try to be as loud as possible so that they will not be out volumed during ipod shuffle play.  They do this by making the average volume approach peak volume.  This means whispers become as loud as shouts.  The end result is degraded sound quality and if you listen to the 1997 version alongside this one on a decent stereo or decent set of headphones, matching the volume levels, you will notice the difference.  The new one lacks punch, has poor sounding cymbal crashes, no dynamics, and intermittent distortion.  Overall, a poor job of mastering, but it's a good 40% louder than the 1997 version.  So if you're thinking of buying this because you want the best sounding version of BTC, don't.However, there are quite a few extras that are worth listening too, especially if you were lucky enough to score the edition that came with the live LP.

The \"Essential\" Charlie Daniels (what happened to the \"Band\"?) has a couple more hits from the decade in question (\"Texas\" from 1976 and \"Mississippi\" from 1979) plus later hits \"Drinkin' My Baby Goodbye\", \"Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues\", and \"Simple Man\".On the other hand, this disc is four dollars cheaper than \"Essential\" as of this writing.  Though it's the same price, I can never recommend any of the tacky \"Super Hits\" CDs.  All three rightly include \"In America\" which, while not Daniels' best song by a long shot, was a big hit absurdly left off the pricey 2-disc set also available.  3 stars for including all the best-known hits at a low price.Based on a true story, \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" remains an amazing song.  1979 suffers from its disco-heavy reputation, but a lot of different sounds broke through on the radio that year and this is a prime example.  The next year I loved \"The Legend of Wooley Swamp\", with its hard rock choruses alternating with mysterious spoken-word verses.  A Halloween staple for me.  \"Uneasy Rider\" was a big hit from a few years earlier, though I was so YOUNG I didn't know of it or the CDB until \"Devil\" hit.  A good novelty song that may not work for fans of later hits, because it suggests a more liberal (hippie?) personality than later songs like \"In America\", \"Simple Man\", and \"A Few More Rednecks\".  To go further out on this limb, I recall reading criticism that 1989's \"Simple Man\" was racist.  I only heard the song once, and there was a line or two that concerned me, but can't recall it well enough to do more than to raise the point.  I hope that neither Mr. Daniels nor his fans intend such sentiments.Audio alert:  I have the 1990 version of this disc.  HOPEFULLY this (1999) version has better sound.

I'm now getting to the point...I didn't realize Buddy's daughter Tracey was in that (1980) film.  I know this means so much to Charlie Daniels fans, but Tracey soon after went on to liven up \"The Young and the Restless\" and is still doing so today.  Well, maybe Monday.  I scanned Mr. Bregman's 9 reviews, and Daniels is the only non-pop/jazz/swing act he's written about.  I think it's a good sign to be singled out for praise by someone from a different genre.

There was a Ruff Ryders Compilation LP, and Eve just dropped her debut, in which both were solid. With DMX dropping his third LP \"...And Then There Was X\", really didn't put too much of an impact on listeners as his first two album did. Possibly because of two things: 1. His repetitive flow; and 2. The trademark ad-libs that he made in the background (his barking being the most common) was all over the album, and were starting to get a little old. So this whole album was very similar of his frist two albums, in which both dropped a year earlier.When he dropped \"What's My Name\" as the lead single, I believed fans were anticipating a rowdy and loud DMX, that they were used to hearing. The fact is that they did get what they were looking for. The problem was, that it was all stale and unappealing, as well as the production. Most of the problems existed in the beginning of the CD, mainly with \"One More Road To Cross\" & \"Fame\". The dissapointments go further down in the CD with more skippable tracks, even with the bonus track where X and a female name Dyme tag-team verses full of sex talk on the song \"Good Girls and Bad Guys\".But this CD isn't all bad though. Aside from it's lead single there were some good tracks. \"X Is Commin' For Ya\" is a dope track. Before it became overrated, \"Party Up\" was another good track. \"D-X-L\" with The Lox and Drag-On was another great track. \"Angel\" with Regina Bell as well as the third single \"What These ****** Want\" with Sisqo are both solid tracks that were better than the skippable ones. Thats all of the good tracks I can think of.This CD as a whole isn't really too special. If you're already a DMX fan, you probably have this album. I just feel that he could have came a little better that what we all expected from him. This album doesn't suck, but it does has it's moments throughout the CD. I have all of X's albums with the exception of his recent \"Year Of The Dog Again\", and I find this to be his worst LP. Yes, even \"Grand Champ\" was better than this album. If you're new to DMX, start with his first two albums to get a better level of how he sounds at his best.

I will write about the 3rd option:The Change & How: The pervious LPs \"Ambrosia\" & \"Somewhere I've Never Travelled\" each had a Pop Rock radio hit, a few clever rockers, & some playful Progressive Rock experiments with or without Classical music. This LP still has a radio hit, a few rockers, but no playful Progressive Rock experiments. Instead this LP has some light Jazz Rock to a few almost Disco songs.The Whys: almost every known Progressive Rock group of the 1970s, later in the decade subtracted their classical music influence or experiments in exchange for Rock, Light Jazz, or semi-Disco. Somehow the general public no longer wanted serious music & almost everyone wanted to dance their way through life. How much of this was forced by the music companies for money, or if the music companies wanted \"ONLY\" to give the general public want they \"SEEMED\" to want? Either way the Progressive Rock groups were made to change their style to meet the then current musical & economic needs. Ambrosia also had no time to write anything serious due to tours etc. & found it easier to put this LP out. One member of the group Christopher North even quit due to this turn of events.Personally I don't mind Rock-N-Roll or POP Rock just as long it has something to say & is done with talent. This LP \"Life Beyond LA\" has the first song I don't like of Ambrosia: \"Dancin' By Myself\" makes no since with the meaning of life & holds no talent in the Rock vain of music.

Not only is she a gifted vocalist, but she is also beautiful, and listening to her voice gives me enjoyment and solace; of course, the songs hold their own, too.  As far as I remember, I had always been aware of her name and the fact that she was a country music artist--but I do not recall ever hearing any of her music until recently.  I did not realize until lately that she was Loretta Lynn's sister, either.  Gayle's voice is attractive, smooth, and soothing.  She utilizes vibrato, but it sounds nice and is not off-putting.  This is a generous compilation--featuring twenty-five songs--that provides a fulfilling overview of what she has to offer.  I like the earthy-sounding quality of her music.  The songs all have something to offer, but the standouts are \"Talking in Your Sleep,\" \"Half the Way,\" and \"You and I.\"  Gayle gives a touching, expressive performance during the chorus of the plaintive \"Talking in Your Sleep.\"  The chorus of the catchy, uptempo \"Half the Way\" is belted out with conviction by Gayle.  She performs a duet with Eddie Rabbitt on \"You and I.\"  This is a special song with a wonderful, affecting chorus.  Also, \"Cry\" provides an impressive showcase for the versatility and prowess of Gayle's voice.  The songs are not in chronological order.

The first two tracks are very strong. \"I Fought in a War\" is a haunting, poetic love song of sparse lines, an evolution in Stuart Murdoch's songwriting skills. \"The Model\" is typical of the first three albums, and is a fine display of Murdoch's sense of (dirty) humour.But then comes \"Beyond the Sunrise\", where Stevie Jackson takes over main vocals and the band plays what sounds like the score to a western film. I wonder how many listeners have done a double take at this, wondering if there were some mixup with the CD or their MP3 playlist. And things never recover from there. The bulk of the songs on FOLD YOUR HANDS CHILD are sung by band members other than Murdoch and bear absolutely no resemblance to the Belle and Sebastian that I fell in love with. Even Murdoch's own subsequent appearances in \"Don't Leave the Light on Baby\" and \"Women's Realm\" sound like an intrusion from another band. Furthermore, as majestic as some of the string arrangements are, it often sounds like the band is playing Fisher-Price instruments.I'd recommendTigermilk,If You're Feeling SinisterandBoy With the Arab Strapto anyone looking for solid pop with endless replay value.

I can't even begin to single out weak tracks. The choruses are consistently bad. The beats are so weak I haven't even had the heart to see who made them. His release with the kids in the chorus is something that nearly made me cry. I guess nobody told Busta that Jay Z wasn't winning any real rap fans over with a kids chorus. My favorite rapper, 2pac, made a song with a kid doing the chorus. To the best of my knowledge he made only one. I could be wrong, but the point is, no really good rap track has ever had little kids singing in it. Leave the kids to sing in Sunday School and make some decent music. A decent attempt from DMX to turn things around near the end of the album can't even change my mind.

Evans and co-producer Paul Worley have a number of interesting ideas, such as mixing the cadence of marching drums with traditional dobro and fiddle on the opening title track and resolving in a rather psychedelic string jam at the end. Evans and her co-writers have some good new songs as well, including the tearful waltz-time ballad, &quot;I Learned That From You&quot; and the upbeat country-rock of &quot;I Keep Looking.&quot; On the other hand, Evans expresses her pop influences rather directly with covers of Edward McCain's &quot;I Could Not Ask For More&quot; (written by Diane Warren) and Bruce Hornsby's &quot;Every Little Kiss.&quot;There's certainly nothing wrong with Evans branching out, trying new things, and spreading her voice across more than one genre.  However, unlike Patty Loveless, who's aided by her husband's brilliant production, Evans and Worley find little synergy between styles.

After 3 volumes of Life and times of Jay-Z, we all know how Jay-Z gets down in the streets. But how many other fans out their have all of his CD's, and still don't know who Jay-Z really is? One listen to Nas, DMX, Common or even Juvenile, you know who they are. After 5 discs, i still have no idea who Sean Carter is. So that's why i'm judging this disc (maybe unfairly) on his potential, rather than his achievement.Cuts like this Can't Be Life, Soon You'll Understand,and Were Have You Been ar reminisant of songs like You Must Love Me and Lucky Me, and are what his fans crave. But songs like Streets is Talkin', Stick to the Script and Squeeze first will have hip-hop fans screaming for Jay-Z to try more challenging material. It such a shame to waste talent his. Yes 1-900-Hustler was interesting (despite the worst cameo in rap history by Freeway), and Parkin' Lot Pimpin' was bangin', but nothing you can put on your resume when the the great rappers are discussed.This should please casual hip-hop fans, despite they way Beanie Sigel (who i think is one of the top 4 MCs right now) dissapointed me and slept walked through the whole disc,and and ever improving Amil was hardly featured. But for us  fans who love our music a little more, you'll  see his &quot;soulless&quot; rapping and view this disc as nothing more than Volumes 1-3  only with a different cover.

Live albums, by nature, are pure industry product.  Think back to the 1970's when record companies could cheaply release a live album (because it cost next-to-nothing to make...no studio time).  Nevertheless, the 90's (and heading into 2000) saw a resurgeance in safe, over-produced live discs.  In fact, three &quot;filler&quot; genres have dominated recent record sales: A) the Greatest Hits/Best Of disc, B) the soundtrack, C) the live album (Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, all those tepid MTV Unplugged thingies).  Occasionally an artist releases a truly important live recording (Dylan's Before the Flood and Warren Zevon's Stand in the Fire both come to mind), but it's damn rare.Thus, I find this EJ offering rather complacent.  Never did I find myself rocking out of my chair or swaying to and fro (with the slower numbers) during this disc.  In particular, Elton's voice sounds kind of rough. Oh, EJ hits all his marks, I guess...he makes his way, workmanlike, through these songs, but I'm not quite sure what makes this one worth owning.  The strongest reason to buy this, perhaps, is the guest appearance by Mary J. Blige, a truly talented R&amp;B artist whom I'm surprised even appeared with Elton (the other guest appearances are mostly forgettable...Bryan Adams????).Mostly, if EJ is going to release pure product, I'd prefer that he include lesser-known songs (of course, the disc wouldn't sell as well).  I'm not sure what he sang during those two nights at Madison Square Garden, but there must be better songs.  What made Live in Australia a halfway decent record (though it, too, isn't great) was Elton's inclusion of very early songs.

Acutally listening to his albums, it's hard to pick any duds isn't it?

'Land of Freelove and Goodbye', 'Jzero' and 'Home' are three off-kilter folk songs that help close the album.I think this album gets dissed because of the hatred vented towards synth heavy pop, the cover and the D word, 'disco'.

Also, 'Drywood' and 'Majik of Majiks' are some of the most focused, stripped down disco songs you will ever hear. And there is no compromising on the melody. In fact I love disco anyway, I'm a little disco diva.

However, after hearing some of the exceptional songs from the Stripes' upcoming \"Elephant\" on the Internet, I was tempted to go back and reexamine the band's music; and I must say that I am now amazed.Jack White is truly a most talented singer/songwriter. His guitar style seems to allow the notes to crackle and spew from his fingers in colorful waves; his voice, a wondrous and slight variation of Robert Plant's howl, is very expressive and charismatic. And I must not forget his wife, Meg--her drums are naive and wonderfully simple, much like those of The Velvet Underground's Maureen Tucker.Many tracks here stand out--the blistering, unforgettable minute-and-a-half that is \"Fell In Love With A Girl,\" the Johnny Cash-meets-garage-rock of \"Hotel Yorba,\" the alluring opener \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground.\" The main slights with the album are that it trails off a bit near the end and is confined by its overly rudimentary instrumentation; it would be more enjoyable if the Stripes loosened up and used a more varied sonic palette, one that extends beyond garage guitar and pounding drums.  However, there is a decent load of strong material in the beginning and middle portions of this record to negate or at least disguise most of the flaws.While I remain unconvinced of the talents of other garage bands such as The Strokes and The Vines, I believe that The White Stripes are one of the best bands operating today.

After his lone Virgin release I KNOW quickly dropped off the charts, Luther signed on J-Records, which is the label formed by former Arista CEO Clive Davis.  In an effort to return Vandross to the mainstream, Davis spared no expense in bringing in a slew of professional producers and songwriters to craft Luther's self-titled J-Records debut.  As a result, Luther only co-wrote 5 of the 14 tracks, and had a fairly minimal hand in producing the disc.  It is very surprising then, that not only does this album work as well as it does, but that it manages to update Luther's sound without completely sacrificing his personality.No matter who wrote the song, nor who produced it, Luther's voice is the central part of every track on this disc - and Luther can put his own spin on anyone's song.  Some highlights include the lovely \"Any Day Now\" (co-penned by Burt Bacharach), the modern-disco of \"Say It Now\" and \"How Do I Tell Her (both of which recall Luther's unsurpassed early-eighties work), and the delightful hit \"Take You Out\" (#26 Pop, #7 R&B;).  The ballads \"Heaven Can Wait\" (#63 R&B;) and \"I'D Rather\" (#83 Pop, #40 R&B;, #17 Adult Contemporary) flopped as singles, but they are both well-crafted recordings, nonetheless.  Of the songs that were co-penned by Luther, the gorgeous ballads \"Like I'm Invisible,\" \"Love Forgot,\" and \"Hearts Get Broken All The Time\" are testaments to his underrated songwriting ability.  Like the best of his work, these three songs take on a unique perspective that makes them distinctive from most love songs.Luther even manages to add another Burt Bacharach/Hal David chestnut under his belt, with the classic \"Are You There (With Another Guy).\"  Though this is a very good record, both consistent and enjoyable, if it only had a tighter feel, or was little more concise or cohesive, than it may have been able to stand with the best of Luther's discography.  Released twenty years after his solo debut, LUTHER VANDROSS peaked at a very impressive #6 on Billboard's Hot 200 - a perfect example of Luther's endearing staying power with record buyers.

The songs are decent if not in the caliber of female singer-songwriter forebears like Carole King or Carly Simon (though, to be fair, Branch is 14...King's first classic [\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\"] was written at age 19 and Simon's 1st great [\"That's the Way I've Always Heard it Should Be\"] at 25.) Probably she most often comes across as \"Alanis Morisette-lite\": angst without anger but every bit as slickly produced as \"Jagged Little Pills\" was.HIGHLIGHTS:\"Everywhere\" is one of the better written songs on the album. It's Branch talking to her \"Mr. Right\"...whoever he may be...and hoping he's looking for her,too, wrapped tight in snappy guitar-based pop-rock. (\"'Cause you're everywhere to me/And when I close my eyes it's you I see/You're everything I know that makes me believe/I'm not alone\") \"All You Wanted\" is catchy pop. \"Something to Sleep to\" is the aftermath of first time sex. (\"In my mind/Everything we did was right/Open your eyes/I'll still be by your side\") Branch approximates Sheryl Crow (indeed she opened for Crow on tour) for \"If Only She Knew\" where she pines for an ex-love who's in the middle of a messy breakup (\"Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind/Though it looks as if it's over/I'm still not over you\"). \"Goodbye to You\" is a great tune, but a bit oversung (the phony emoting at the end of the line \"deep down in my soul-uh\" is a prime example). \"Drop in the Ocean\" closes the album on a high note with a surprising arrangement that veers from a stark ballad to a flat out techno beat.LOWS:\"You Get Me\" COULD have been a good song because longing for understanding is something everyone feels, but Branch sabotages it with a bunch of cliches and the giggle that starts the track. Producer John Shanks also uses 'of the moment' electronic voice-in-a-can effects that ensure the song will date almost immediately. \"Sweet Misery\" is too coated with synths and production tricks to come across as sincere.BOTTOM LINE:If all you want is catchy pop that's really hummable, she fills the bill. Certainly there's more soul baring going on in these songs than a multitude of recent young musical wunderkinds. (think Aaron Carter or Lil Bow Wow). But the songs are still a bit lightweight to be ones you'll continue to play years from now. Branch is young, though, so I'm hoping continued work on her writing (and the vocal maturity that will come with more age and performance) and not so much glossy production will mean great pieces of art in the future.3 1/2 stars", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not outstanding yet but give her time", "unixReviewTime": 1114560000, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2005"}

The point of this album is to work with songs written from a strongly male point of view, and reinterpret them in a female fashion. You gotta love Tori for taking a risk like this, because she doesn't even change the gender of the narrator in these songs, which leads to many mind-boggling and creepy moments. Unfortunately, it seems that Tori selected most of these songs for their lyrical concepts, rather than any musical merit. This is unfortunate, because this isn't a book of poetry, but music that you have to listen to. Many of these songs were originally straight rock or hard rock, and have been very awkwardly transformed to Tori's style. About the only song on this album with ear-catching music is &quot;Strange Little Girl,&quot; (which I think is by the new wave band Sad Caf&eacute;, but I'm not sure) and maybe &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot; (Tom Waits and Lou Reed respectively). Another catchy tune is 10cc's &quot;I'm Not In Love&quot; in which Tori transforms the sappy soft-rock of the original into a creepy and obsessive dirge.Otherwise, most of the music on this album doesn't work. Depeche Mode's &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; is very boring as a basic piano ballad, and Tori's guitar rock attempt at Neil Young's &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; is noisy and almost unlistenable. The Beatles' &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; is transformed into a ten-minute groove with voluminous speeches by George W. Bush and other politicians, but this experiment is mostly a never-ending disaster. Tori takes another huge leap by turning Slayer's &quot;Raining Blood&quot; from speed metal to symphonic balladry, but for this to make sense, the rhythm has to be slowed down to such snail-like levels that you think the track is never going to end.Even with this problematic music, Tori does break through with some of the lyrical interpretations on this album. Joe Jackson's treatise on the challenges faced by gay males, &quot;Real Men,&quot; becomes very thought-provoking when delivered by a woman. And you can't avoid the cover of Eminem's &quot;'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde.&quot; In the original, Eminem sounded hateful and ignorant in this song which boasts of killing his wife while his young daughter watches.

The song really doesn't offer &quot;listenable return&quot;, unless someone is trying to plot something.  The title track, &quot;Strange Little Girl(s)&quot; is very impressive.  It's probably the best 'rocking' track on the album.  Personally, I prefer the Depeche Mode original of &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; because it had a sonic vibe of its own.  Tori basically strips the song down, simply utilizing her vocals, some quiet synth strings, and cascading adagio piano.  &quot;I'm Not In Love&quot; did not really grab me.  It is mostly a languid programmed drum beat.  If you are not entranced by Tori's voice here, you will probably frequently skip this song.  &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot; has a nice folksy-rock-sway to it.  The soothing acoustic guitar, brushing rhythms, calm Fender Rhodes, and Tori's diffused vocals definitely makes this song one of my favorites.  &quot;Time&quot; feels like a late-night small country bar recitation.  Tori returns to her piano/vocal formula, adding some lyrical optimism.  Tori continues the story recitation mode on &quot;I Don't Like Mondays&quot;, switching over to rhodes/vocal.  I really appreciate her heavenly narration and rhodes playing because it helps me find some peace in these busy days.  &quot;Raining Blood&quot; reflects strains of invocation.  I don't think that Tori has ever been as 'Gothic' as she is on this song.  If you thought &quot;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; was unnerving, then this track will certainly give your attention a run!  &quot;Real Men&quot; offers a subtle and moot closing to this album, riddled with so much poignant intensity.If you are a dedicated Tori Amos fan, then I would suggest that you buy this album.  If you are new to her music, I would suggest that you return to her previous albums and get a sense of this woman's power, before delving into the realm of &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "An Album of Covers, But Still Satisfactory", "unixReviewTime": 1000944000, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2001"}

The reason they don't work so well? Usually it's because the extended family just isn't that talented.But with the Dungeon Family, an exception must be made. True, stars like Outkast and Goodie MOb outshine most of their colleagues. But the releases from the Dungeon Family the past few years have been very strong. Cool Breeze's \"Watch for the Hook\" had some bangin' tracks. Sleepy's Theme's \"The Vinyl Room\" was a nice chunk of laid-back funk. Even Backbone's rocky \"Concrete Law\" had some very good moments.And let's not forget that the DF has Organized Noize, one of the more adventurous and innovative production teams, manning the boards on almost every release. So \"Even in Darkness\" turns out to be exactly the what you would expect from a family reunion: there's a few relatives you don't really like, but at the end of the day, it was a good time.The front half of the album isn't as good as it could be, but interesting nonetheless. Mr. DJ of ET3 Productions handles the tracks that Organized Noize doesn't, and while his beats prove to be long on innovation, some of them distract from the vocals.It's the back half that really kicks the album into high gear, start with \"Forever Pimpin' (Never Slippin').\" A short track with a chopped string melody and some deeeeEEEEEEEp bass, Cool Breeze flips his conversational flow for a strong two minutes you can bump in the trunk anytime. The posse-cut homage \"6 Minutes\" is probably the best song on the album, with most of the Family making a brief appearance over a slammin' track.But it's the surprises that really make \"Darkness\" worth it. Bubba Sparxxx shows up on the bouncy \"White Gutz,\" whose syncopated beat sounds odd at first, but really grows on you. \"Excalibur\" and \"Rollin',\" however, use loping, 3/4 beats. The former is a heavy spiritual track, rounding out w/the entire family singing the hook, \"We are the few/the strong/the proud holders of the Excalibur.\" And the latter is some slooooooow Cadillac trunk funk with old-school horns and a nice chorus (\"Are you rooooollin'/Down the same street that I'm goooooin'/Up the same (...) that I'm foooooldin'/On a new riiiide\").There are also some strong appearances on the uptempo \"What Iz Rap?\" by the Witchdoctor and by some DF unknowns on \"Curtains.\" Overall, some tracks could be better, but this is definitely a worthwhile ride on the Trans-DF Express.

The collection also includes a pair of new tracks-- \"Cut Here\" and \"Just Say Yes\".  Both are driven by programmed rhythms and while \"Cut Here\" is decent enough, I actually find the somewhat forced ecstacy of \"Just Say Yes\" to be downright irritating.But there is a lot missing, and with the record clocking in at only 68 minutes, there was room for a bit more-- no \"Killing An Arab\" or \"10:15 Saturday Night\" from their early days, nothing at all from \"Faith\", \"Pornography\" or \"The Top\", with several pieces from those albums being fine candidates (\"Shake Dog Shake\", \"Primary\", non-album track \"Charolotte Sometimes\", \"The Hanging Garden\" or live set feature \"One Hundred Years\") and a noticably absent \"Pictures of You\" from \"Disintegration\" (curiously, it was included on the European release of the record).  Maybe a two disc set would have served better, but certainly some of these could have been included with some songs quite frankly making me wonder why they were chosen in place of those (\"High\" for example).Still, no collection is perfect, and this one does a pretty good job at what it targets.  If you're new to the band, it's a decent overview.A final note, when the album was initially released, it included a bonus disc with acoustic renditions of all the songs on the record-- fans will want to track this one down.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A bit thin of a career retrospective.", "unixReviewTime": 1156291200, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2006"}

Highsmith", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "After releasing Queensbridge classics such as &quot;LA, LA&quot;, &quot;Illegal Life&quot;, Stick You&quot;, &quot;T.O.N.Y.&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; with partner in crime Capone, Noreaga has taken a different path with his music.  N.O.R.E. has become someone that just wants to have fun and have a good time with his music.  Noreaga will never be in a best lyricist Top 20 or he will never be known for his great lyrics, but he always finds a way to get your attention.  That is Victor Santiago's niche in the rap game.  He can always get your attention.  On his debut solo CD, once &quot;Superthug&quot; was released to radio, you couldn't tell Noreaga anything because he had one of the hottest songs on the street and on radio.  If it wasn't for this hit song, the Neptunes might not even be around today and that is the truth.  Other memorable moments from his debut CD include &quot;Banned From TV&quot; w/Big Pun, Cam'ron, Nature &amp; The LOX, &quot;The Assignment&quot; w/Busta Rhymes, Spliff Star &amp; Maze, the first single, &quot;N.O.R.E.&quot;, &quot;Body In The Trunk&quot; w/Nas, and &quot;I Love My Life&quot; w/Carl Thomas.  On his second CD, &quot;Melvyn Flynt- Da Hustler&quot;, it seemed Noreaga was uninspired and that his label was trying to capitalize on the success of &quot;Superthug&quot; to soon.  Although, the first single, &quot;Oh No&quot; was prodcued by The Neptunes and was a success, the rest of the CD was very lackluster.  Other than &quot;Sometimes&quot;, which was a tribute to his late father,  the CD was filled with filler material.  Once his partner Capone returned home after being incarcerated they recorded their last CD for Tommy Boy records entitled &quot;The Reunion&quot;.  This reminded me of the Noreaga that I expected from his &quot;War Report&quot; days.  Songs like &quot;Bang Bang&quot; w/Foxy Brown, &quot;Phonetime&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot; where he even admits that &quot;Melvyn Flynt&quot; was wack, &quot;B EZ&quot; w/Nas, and &quot;Y'all Don't Wanna&quot; were songs worth hearing from the Queens duo.  Now signed to Def Jam Records, Noreaga is here for a fresh start.  The switching of labels has done Noreaga some good and the results are pretty good.  First of all, some of the material is outdated, the CD's official 1st single, &quot;Grimey&quot; was actually released on the &quot;Violator 2&quot; CD.  The Neptunes drop a nasty beat and the words flow from Noreaga's voice like he has been working with The Neptunes since birth.  Although many fans may be tired of hearing Noreaga over The Neptunes' beats, that's when he is at his best.  The 2nd single from &quot;God's Favorite&quot;, &quot;Nothin'&quot; is another Neptunes track and is definitely all over radio and the club scene at this time.  He won't win any points for originality, but this formula seems to work.  &quot;Live My Life&quot; w/Ja Rule was supposed to be the 2nd single but after receiving a lukewarm reception from radio stations, Def Jam decided to go back to the drawing board, which was smart.  &quot;Nothin'&quot; will definitely get Noreaga the gold plaque that he is accustomed to getting.  Other noteworthy tracks include, &quot;Full Mode&quot;, which will definitely be the next single after &quot;Nothin&quot; wears out its welcome, &quot;Head Bussa&quot;, the remix of the Swizz Beats track, &quot;Nahmeanuheard&quot; w/Cam'ron, Fat Joe, Cassidy &amp; Capone, &quot;Black Clouds&quot; and &quot;Mr. CEO&quot;.  I agree with reviewer anthony humphrey on his opinions about the song &quot;Big D&quot;.  This song was just a bad idea and probably just a way to get Akinyele on the CD.  We don't need to hear Noreaga spit Spice channel type rhymes.  Other filler tracks include &quot;Wanna Be Like Him&quot; w/Mashonda and &quot;Banned From Another Club&quot;.  &quot;Consider This&quot; w/Kelis has a catchy beat but the song is ruined when Noreaga starts talking about his &quot;merry mack, all dressed in black&quot;.  I mean, how unoriginal is that.  &quot;Love Ya Moms&quot; was a good idea and is a good track, altogether.  Overall, Noreaga has definitely showed improvement since his last solo offering.  After a Def Jam Capone N Noreaga CD, Noreaga might have somethiing for us the fourth time around.  He needs to improve on his subject matter but as long as he has good producers around him, he will always make some kind of impact on the rap game.  Also, check out Track 19, &quot;The Life Of A... (Gangsta)&quot;, the bonus track with Capone &amp; Chinky.  It is worth listening to.  I actually rate this CD 3 and a half stars, but if you're not a fan of Noreaga then of course your rating will be lower than mine.James' Top 51. Grimey2. Nothin'3. Full Mode4.

His 2001 album \"The Return of the Regulator\" is his weakest effort, but one that's still worth a listen for his fans in my mind. This album succeeds in most of the areas that his earlier efforts do, but fails in a few notable areas. His first three albums, 1994's classicRegulate...G Funk Era, 1997'sTake a Look Over Your Shoulder, and 1999'sI Want It Allwere all marked by his wonderful production, his signature g-funk sound with rich instrumentation, laidback vibes and a soulful, slow-rolling feel that evoked images of his sunny California home. On \"The Return of the Regulator,\" the sound is a little different, adjusting to the evolving West Coast sound following Dr. Dre's influential2001album. The beats are generally more upbeat and less smooth than before. Personally I find the beats here to be weaker than on any of his other LPs, but his musical talent remains. He still fills his tracks with clever arrangements, and they're always catchy, even if they don't have the irresistable soulfulness he's known for.\"The Return of the Regulator\" has many good songs, but few really great ones. Time and time again, Warren has proven able to craft true anthems and classic songs, and there are none to be found on this effort. That's not to say it's not a solid album though, because there aren't any noticeably bad songs either. Overall, it's just not as memorable an album. Part of this is due to the subject matter. Warren's always been a producer first and a rapper second, but this is brought to the forefront here. Usually, he makes do by rapping about his Long Beach, California hometown and reminiscing over growing up, and his likable character makes his verses appealing. This doesn't happen enough here, and his crew of guests too often lacks the big names of his earlier albums, replacing them with more ordinary MCs like Mista Grimm, Boss Hogg and Damone. \"The Return of the Regulator\" is Warren G's weakest album, but despite its flaws it still showcases his talent as a producer and artist.The album opens with a full-length intro, which consists of a simple, bouncy beat, Warren's commentary, and a verse by Damone. \"Lookin' at You\" is an eerie Dr. Dre production with an appearance from Ms. Toi on vocals, Warren's verses are a bit lackluster but it's a solid cut. The joyful-sounding \"Here Comes Another Hit\" features Nate Dogg on the hook and a verse from Mista Grimm for an early, energetic highlight. \"Somethin' to Bounce To\" is also upbeat and sunny, Soopafly and Warren display nice chemistry without any substantial lyricism. \"This Gangsta S... Is Too Much\" isn't quite as memorable, despite a cool beat and guest by Butch Cassidy. \"Young Locs Slow Down\" is probably the best song, featuring Butch Cassidy at his eerie best and WC with a nice guest as well. The beat is somber, catchy, and clever, using a twangy guitar line. The album takes a turn for the worse at this point, beginning with \"Speed Dreamin',\" an awkward collabo with George Clinton and Mista Grimm, and \"Yo' Sassy Ways,\" a forgettable 213 collabo. After the okay posse cut \"It Ain't Nothin' Wrong With U\" comes one of my favorites, \"Ghetto Village.\" This song makes use of a famous Stevie Wonder sample, and Warren speaks of growing up in his Long Beach neighborhood over a clever laidback beat. \"They Lovin' Me Now\" is cool, but like too much on this album, not substantial enough to be truly memorable. \"Streets of LBC\" is likably unsettling, and \"G-Funk Is Here to Stay\" is alright but just doesn't quite work. The album closes with a deep, well-executed ode to Warren's mother called \"Keepin' It Strong.\" It's a more soulful, somber version of \"Ola Mae\" fromI Want It All.\"The Return of the Regulator\" has a few flaws, but the catchy production for the most part makes it a solid album that I recommend to his fans. The title and cover art recall his classic debut, and this album would never be compared to it. I highly recommend each of his other LPs, and this one should only be owned by those who already own and love his other four. If not for the wonderful quality of his earlier records, this album would be remembered as a better effort.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Warren's weakest effort, still worth a listen", "unixReviewTime": 1195689600, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2007"}

Either through the grace of God or the co-writing/production of Glen Ballard (or both), it overwhelmingly worked in its unorthodox way. However, on Under Rug Swept it has gone terribly out of control. It dominates almost every song, all of which sound unusually glossy when compared to Alanis's previous work. It's not that there's nothing wrong with turning from a critical darling (back) to a shimmery popstress, but i don't have to like it. Glen Ballard, where did you go?It isn't that Alanis Morissette's third American studio effort is terrible, it's just that it's unrefined... and it's hard not draw a connection from there to her suddenly solo writing and production duties. Under Rug Swept honestly sounds as though Alanis walked into the studio and proceeded to record without ever pausing to edit any lyrical aspect of her songs. Witness the rambly nonsense of \"21 Things I Want In A Lover,\" the awkward phrasing of the otherwise excellent \"Hands Clean,\" and the altogether ill-advised thunder of \"A Man.\" The unusual indisputable hits that we've come to expect are entirely absent, unless you count the epilectic electric guitars of kiss-off \"Narcissus,\" which verge very closely on being annoying.There are two songs on this disc that prove that Alanis is still a force to be reckoned with. \"So Unsexy\" combines a simple two-measure guitar riff with an equally simple bass line, and upon these strong foundations Alanis vents her unedited spleen in the effective fashion that we've come to expect from her; its at once sweet and defiant, and totally catchy. \"Flinch\" is slowly strummed classic, loaded with real couplets and an actual narrative. For just a track it hijacks the pop production of the disc for its own purposes, and comes out as the plainest and best heartbreak ballad in Alanis's entire catalogue.Hearing this pair of tunes makes it clear that there are still good songs to be heard from our erstwhile Canadian friend; obviously someone just has to figure out how to whittle them down after they effortlessly flow out of her.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Under Rug Swept?

The album lovingly grooves along with rich vocals, soulful ballads and acoustic underpinnings.Instrumentation and musicianship take a refreshing front seat over heavily produced, trendy R&B.; Filled with impressive gems and intoxicating rhythms, there's a song for almost every melodic mood. \"Best Friend\" is a reclined slow jam that pares up the laid-back, no fuss stylings of Tweet to the warmth of neo-soulite Bilal.The range of Southern Hummingbird is remarkably multifaceted; from the stripped-down microphone & guitar vibe of \"Motel\" to the heartbreaking dark of \"Drunk\" which howls with carousing abandon (\"I'd rather be drunk on a cloud far away from here than sober\") and inebriating to-and-fro melody. There's a foray into early '80s synth-soul with the old school-esque jam \"Make Ur Move,\" a throwback to the roller discos and poplockers of the era of excess and even tiptoes into honky-tonk country (\"Complain\").Largely the artist herself culls most of the album's more potent material. Her more than 10 years toiling as an aspiring solo artist have paid off: Her skills as a songwriter, drummer and acoustic guitarist are impressively detailed here.More complex than anything that can currently be offered up by a trio of \"bootylicious\" singers or a girl that's not yet a woman, Tweet's voice exhibits a unique redolence similar to the soul sirens of the seventies - Minnie Riperton, Evelyn Champagne King and Angela Bofill - rather than keeping up with the interchangeable chicks featured on the hook of a rap track.She is distinctive amongst the crowded school of R&B; fish. Her album is one that opts to lead by being lyrically open and musically adventurous. An old school-inspired record brimming with new school promise, Southern Hummingbird is the diary of an emerging musical talent on the rise.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Tweet excavates a suprisingly good debut", "unixReviewTime": 1017705600, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2002"}

Since I haven't listened to \"Hell Hath No Fury\" just yet, I can't compare it to this debut album, but \"Lord Willin'\" stands on its own as a satisfying, but flawed, record.If there's anything that makes \"Lord Willin'\" stand out from other average Hip-Hop albums, it's The Neptunes, who produce the album in its entirety. The beats are harder and far more thrilling and invigorating than the majority of their more recent efforts, especially on the minimalist-beat-driven hustler's anthem \"Grindin'\" & \"Young Boy\", a lyrically reflective club jam driven by Pharrell William's lively hook and bombastic Funk-inflected horns strangely -if not ironically- reminiscent of Beyonce's R&B;/Funk club jam \"Work It Out\", another Neptunes concoction.Unfortunately, one of the album's problems lies with Clipse themselves. There's no denying the fact that the two are strong rappers -their vocal delivery is cold, harsh, strong, fearless and emotionless- but it's hard to tell Malice & Pusha T apart due to their similar flows and vocals. That doesn't mean that they can't write good lyrics - songs like the aforementioned \"Grindin'\", the gloomy, anthemic \"Virginia\" and the straightforward album standout \"Cot Damn\" (feat. Pharrell Williams as hook singer and everyone else -Ab-Liva & Roscoe P Coldchain- as rappers) prove otherwise, while many of the other album's tracks display their knack for clever and inventive wordplay.It is at this point, however, that we realise the album's second fundamental flaw - its lack of substance. Songs like the admittedly addictive \"When The Last Time\" -featuring Pharrell Williams as hook rapper & Kelis as severely underused R&B; songstress, who is restricted to a simple vocal refrain on the song's bridge over The Neptunes' heavy synths and faint guitar loop- & the self-explanatory \"Ego\" resort to the ways of misogyny, commercialism and materialism that has rapidly deteriorated modern-day Hip-Hop, while other songs like \"Ma, I Don't Love Her\" (feat. another underutilised R&B; singer, Faith Evans) & \"Gangsta Lean\" (feat. Pharrell as -you guessed it!- hook singer) are virtually devoid of true emotion or sentiment.The final problem I have with this album is the excess guest appearances. Not only do Clipse lack emotion or passion in their delivery, but they also lack any form of personality or individuality that could've otherwise separated them apart from not only each other, but the album's other truckload of guest artists. Whether or not Pharrell Williams is credited as an official guest artist is of little concern, since he drops a lively contribution (mainly a hook) on almost all of the tracks on the album. While that may be good for the memorability factor or the quality of the actual tracks, it also highlights the Clipse's inability to consistently craft solid, infectious hooks. Other guests include all of the aforementioned artists (Ab-Liva, Roscoe P Coldchain, Kelis, Pharrell Williams, Faith Evans), Famlay (\"Famlay Freestyle\"), Fabolous (\"Comedy Central\", where is style is easily more recognizable), Jermaine Dupri (\"Lets Talk About It\") and Jadakiss & Styles P of the Lox (\"I'm Not You\"). The two remixes of \"Grindin'\" also feature NO.R.E., Baby & Lil' Wayne on the first remix, while Sean Paul, Kardinal Offishall & Bless appear on the latter.As a whole, this is a solid debut, but is too flawed to be deemed a classic. The Clipse should consider themselves lucky to have The Neptunes on their side because they, along with Kelis, tend to bring the best out of the production duo. 3 stars!5 Best Tracks (IMO) (In No Order):\"Grindin'\" (original version)\"Virginia\"\"Cot Damn\"\"Young Boy\"\"Comedy Central\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "\"Lord Willin'\" - Neptunes Please, The Clipse Disappoint, Pharrell's Omnipresent & Guests Are Heavy", "unixReviewTime": 1167004800, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2006"}

It's almost as if she's heard so many people tell her that her first record was so positive that it's hamstrung her from taking too many chances on this record with the messages.  This album is cursed with the kind of \"We Are the World\" heavy-handedness that ruined the better part of the Lauryn Hill live record earlier this year.Great playing mired in WAY heavy-handed and too-simple lyrics.  The musical equivalent of an Iyanla Vanzant seminar, which is unfortunate because her first album was a classic and a much-needed shot in the arm of a musical arena saturated with negativity.  This, however, is too far at the other end of the love/hate spectrum.  If I wanted a gospel album, I'd have bought a gospel album.  She's clearly fallen in love since the last record as well, which is fine, but because of that there's a lot of not-great sap here too.  Not even racy, midnight-mood, slow-jammy sap...it's just simplistic I'm-in-love type stuff that, lyrically, you could get anywhere.The shining track here is \"The One\" but it's not enough to justify buying the record if you liked the risks and confidence of her first record.  This is all a terrible shame; I wanted to like this one, especially after the constant robbing of Arie by the year of (groan) Alicia Keyes, but this record falls short in the most important department: the message.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too preachy, even for fans", "unixReviewTime": 1032998400, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2002"}

Mainly it grows from a dissatisfaction with ones station in life, judicial practices, civil inequity. One begins to grow tired of the hypocrisy of life and the government. On the cover we are greeted by a king and queen who have been killed and left as bones it seems after a riot of the people. Who were probably dissatisfied by their government.

Only eddie can get away with such lyrics as &quot;It's been said so many times, but can't be said enough, all you need is love.&quot; I believe him. His simple harmony and slurred voice just say it so honestly that you would follow him down that road. This  record for Pearl Jam is a ressurrection from the decent but nothing special Binaural, and  does not  give in to today's standards in music.  Pearl Jam has always written music from the soul that drives the band. There are reasons why they have lasted as long as they have. Since their debut many bands  have  come and gone and yet they strive in success (on tour not television) Fans remain true because the band has remained true to the fans. There are many gems on this record that remind me of the best songs on Binaural such as Thin Air and Nothing as it Seems. Pearl Jam has always been a mix of the mellow and harder rock of yester-year.I have taken a bit of a hiatus from PJ's songs and have returned to this record with a renewed love for the band. Every song has it's own hook that I simply adore. It's an album with heart and  honesty written all over it. It touches on some political aspects facing the world today and although PJ has always seemed disconnected from the world, and in a world all their own, they emerge briefly to comment on Mr. Bush and the politics of our Post 9/11 world. This is a band that has a history and legs to continue just like Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, etc.This record continues  their legacy and it's something they should be proud of.If you are new to PJ.

Erykah Badu was always known to reinvent herself from each album, almost her way of showing you that she's growing. Well... Maybe she grew too much, because this EP is in many ways a disappointment. One of the main problems that affect this album is the lyrics. The lyrics to \"I Want You\", although has it's guilty-pleasure of a rhythm, becomes very repetitive. Another problem lies in this new style of Erykah's. Erykah has now taken it to herself to make her songs as long (or in some cases, short, almost incomplete) as possible; This is her way of not feeling \"restricted\" &amp; not being \"obligated\" to limit her songs to 4 minutes. \"I Want You\" is about 11 minutes long, and most of it, Erykah is just stretching out the hook. I wouldn't mind if an 11-minute version of a song appeared on a live album, since it sometimes takes time to set a vibe, but I expect better quality version on a studio version. The major problem is the length of the album as a whole. Excluding the pointless intro &amp; outro, \"World Keeps turnin'\", this album only contains 8 tracks: \"Think Twice\" is basically a filler, \"Love of My Life Worldwide\" is a horrible, and unnecessary remix, &amp; \"Steady on the Grind\" sounds like the M1 (of Dead Prez) version of Me'Shell Ndeg&eacute;Ocello's \"Dead N**** Blvd.\", just with Erykah singing the hook. \"Woo\" would've worked much better as the intro instead of &quot;World Keeps Turnin'&quot;, since it's a medley of Erykah singing reminiscent lyrics, giving shout outs (with people she toured with), &amp; chanting, \"woo!\" And although I do like the song \"Danger (Block On Lock)\", there something in me that wants to hate it, because this is yet another song where Erykah tries to remind us of her debut, \"Baduizm\"; On Mama's Gun, There is the track \"... &amp; On\", which is obviously part two of \"On &amp; On\", and now it's \"Danger\", part two of \"Other Side Of The Game\". It's a little immature, and I'm beginning to think that Erykah can't let go of her past. She should take her own advice: No Turning Back (\"My Life\", Mama's Gun)But there is one song I like very well; the funky \"Bump It\" (although she some-what ruins it with the unnecessary echoing-vocal-harmonizing at about 5:35, the song is 8:51)When it comes down to it, Erykah slacked off on this album, especially with the lyrics. She has this new \"let things flow\" attitude that just isn't cutting it. The only good tracks are \"Bump It\", \"Woo\", &amp; \"Danger\". They all possess that Funk... but they're not even all that great, aightt-at best. There are guilty pleasures like \"I Want You\" &amp; \"Back in the day\", but their replay values seem very low. It seems that all the songs with at least a bit of substance are the shortest, while the low quality tracks seem to last forever. Also, at times, it seems like Erykah and her crew just got a new mix board with sound effects, and started to record the stuff they were experimenting with (listen to the outro). There isn't a sufficient amount of satisfying songs, leaving this album to feel incomplete. Still, Erykah Badu is very talented, and if you want to hear her best works, get \"Mama's Gun\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "&quot;Think Twice&quot;", "unixReviewTime": 1063929600, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2003"}

But, whatever.I'll say up front, I am a fan of Erykah Badu. I own everything she's ever released. In fact, I bought \"Worldwide Underground\" as soon as it dropped without having heard a note on it.I'm sad to say, though, that I was a little disappointed.Yes, I GET that it's transitional. And I GET that she was trying to experiment, which is admirable. And I GET that she wanted to expand the parameters of  Neo-Soul, both in terms of sonic textures and running times (\"I Need You\" and \"Bump It\" clock-in at around 10 minutes each.) And in some ways, it reminds me a bit of albums like Isaac Hayes' \"Hot Buttered Soul,\" where there's only a handful of tracks and the grooves unfold sometimes over the course of fifteen-twenty minutes. But this EP (it's only 10 songs deep) struggles because of lack of focus.Don't get me wrong, there are some great ideas and moments on here. The last couple of minutes of \"Bump It\" where Badu vocalizes with Karon Wheeler and Zap Mama are mesmerizing. And \"Back in the Day (Puff)\" was one of the best songs of 2003, hands-down--it hits you from the beginning with a tight beat, catchy hook, and clever vocals.  It's signature Erykah Badu. Plus, the new version of \"Love of My Life\" where she freaks \"Funk You Right On Up\" by the Sequence (with Angie Stone, a.k.a. Angie B, on vocals) is flawless.  \"Think Twice\" is also so soulful that it hurts; its just a bit too truncated.But then it all kind of falls apart with the grab bag of tracks on the rest of the album, which vary between playing it super safe (\"The Grind\" and \"Danger\") and experimenting to the point of being aimless. The latter is true on \"I Need You,\" where a monotonous, one-note-played-over-a-heartbeat intro lasts almost two minutes before the groove even gets going, and then it never REALLY gets going.  Around the 8-minute mark, it dissolves into a distorted jam session, which just about the time you think will segue into a Funkadelic-type chunk o' funk, it fades out into (yet another) rehashing of \"Sometimes\" off \"Baduizm.\" (\"Woo\" probably is hot when she does it live, but here it falls flat.) And speaking of \"Baduizm,\" \"Danger\" is the other side of the other side of \"The Other Side of The Game.\" (If Neo-Soul is dead, like the cover art indicates, no use beating it to death...)Anyway, the warning is: don't expect a full-fledged album. This is more a loose mix of unfinished thoughts, clever ideas, and developing genius. It's worth buying simply for \"Back in the Day,\" if nothing else.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good but not Great (3.5 stars)", "unixReviewTime": 1083369600, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2004"}

Phillips", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Erykah Badu first entered the music industry in 1997 with a fresh, jazzy neo-soul sound that instantly brought critical acclaim and even comparisons to all-time greats, such as Billie Holiday and Chaka Khan. Her superb debut album, Baduizm, won her two Grammy Awards, and was soon certified triple-platinum by the RIAA. Badu's raw, soulful, and introspective sophomore album, Mama's Gun, was equally praised, and most modern R&B; fans would agree that it is a classic. Three years later came this so-called EP--which proves to be both a disclaimer and misnomer for this fifty-minute collection of ten songs--Worldwide Underground.A misnomer because EPs are not usually meant to be more than twenty-five minutes in length, a disclaimer because this experimental rough sketch is not meant to be the predecessor of Mama's Gun. This, of course, disappointed many of Erykah's fans, who had been waiting patiently for a rightful third album from the quirky singer. However, if listened to with a free mind and no expectations, Worldwide is not the huge disappointment it's been made out to be.The addictive \"Danger,\" in my honest opinion, is one of the best songs Badu has crafted in her entire career. Telling the tale of a drug dealer's ride-or-die girlfriend with a guilty conscience, the track serves as an upbeat and energetic sequel to her earlier hit single, \"Otherside of the Game.\" Over deep, thumping bass and sharp horns, Erykah plays the part with extreme skill and style. The hook-heavy, six-minute ride through the dark city never gets old to me. \"I Want You,\" about a strong (and distracting) longing for a lover, is quite a long track, clocking in at almost eleven minutes. But it still never fails to fascinate me with each and every listen. Beginning with a sparse and slow heartbeat, the track continues to accelerate in tempo and passion until a cool breakdown with soulful background vocals. It then begins to slow from there on, soon leading Ms. Badu's vocals to sound like they were chopped and screwed like some Southern hip-hop. It then cuts into a killer electric guitar solo from Lenny Kravitz. Finally it fades out, with Erykah singing, \"first of all/ when I tell you I love you/ don't mean I do,\" making the whole song a bit of a mystery to me. Was she simply infatuated, but not in love? \"Love of My Life Worldwide,\" a semi-remake of The Sequence's late `70s hit \"Funk You Up,\" is probably the most fun and accessible one of the bunch. Erykah, who originally began as an emcee named Apples at the tender age of fourteen, shows her skills on the mic. Queen Latifah, who has been out of the rap game for quite a while, stops by to party. Angie Stone, one third of The Sequence, puts her stamp of approval on the track and Bahamadia also shows up. The song is like a big ol' celebration on wax. The spontaneous collaboration was a great choice for the last full song on the album.As excellent as some of the EP is, the album is equally flawed. The \"World Keeps Turning\" intro and outro really weren't necessary, and are just ways to take up space, if anything. \"Woo,\" which was apparently created to replicate one of her stage-show experiments, falls terribly flat. \"The Grind\" is pretty jumbled and confusing, too. \"Bump It\" is pretty enjoyable, but I don't think all the improvising at the end of the song was necessary, even though I do love Zap Mama. \"Think Twice\" would've been one of my favorite tracks if it weren't cut short and rushed for no reason at all. It's like she was giving an intimate performance in a jazz club, and then she had to bring it to an abrupt stop after a fire started and the audience had to evacuate the building. I can take or leave the sing-songy \"Back In The Day (Puff),\" where Erykah reminisces on her childhood.The bottom line: The rough-around-the-edges and experimental Worldwide Underground is neither an EP nor a proper follow-up to the excellent Mama's Gun. Even at a short ten tracks, it has some filler and minor missteps; however, it still contains a few stellar tracks that make it worthwhile and a pretty enjoyable listen.Key tracks: I Want You, Danger, Love of My Life Worldwide.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3   stars - Flawed, but an enjoyable listen overall.", "unixReviewTime": 1198454400, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2007"}

Guru is real clear on this cut and once again shows some flow. \"Who Got Gunz\" is a CD highlight featuring Fat Joe and M.O.P. Wild!! I love this cut.

You really have to work at listening to this -- plod through the oblique lyrics and the unpredictable chord progressions and there's some reward to be had. But like most kids of the 70's, I already had my run-in with prog, slogging, through arduous works by Crimson and Yes and Tull and ELP; why should I have to go through the same contortions with my post-punk albums? Malkmus certainly knows how to deliver something punchy and visceral; the first two Pavement albums were near-perfect achievements: catchy and energetic, yet innovative and unpredictable. But somewhere along the line, he stopped caring so much about the sonic wallop and the hooks that gave backbone to his lyrical musings. Sure, there's still the occasional tune that you can hum along with, and his first post-Pavement solo album hinted at a return to tunefulness. But aside from a couple almost-catchy tracks, Pig Lib meanders all over the place. That's not always a bad thing. A few of the offbeat tracks here -- &quot;(Do Not Feed The) Oyster&quot; comes to mind -- manage to keep you guessing where they're going next without causing you to lose interest altogether. But on several tracks, I found myself listening to an otherwise annoying song in the hope that at some point he'd kick in with a compelling musical or lyrical phrase. Sometimes there'd be pay-off, but I don't see myself going through that effort too many more times.

I think others would feel the same way if they just open there minds. But instead, most people have this mental block for things they see on MTV. Big deal. I think one of the big +'s about Linkin Park is they CAN appeal to a wider audience (not saying they do). If you understand hip-hop, you will understand that Linkin Park's MC is actually quite good, and can flow very well. The singer Chester can scream quite intensly, and has proven with \"Breaking the Habit\" that he can sing well. Is he the best singer in rock? No, but he CAN sing. Anyone who thinks otherwise is in simple denile.I think the biggest problem with this CD is it feels rushed in some songs. It took them 3 years to come out with 36 min worth of music? Not very impressive. I think the Intro is very weak as well. 13 secs of typical movie sounds. The point to an intro is to capture the mood for the rest of the album, this fails to do that in my opinion. So therefore, it's a waste of space on the CD.In the positive scope of this album, I will say although a lot of the lyrics are whiney, it's still relatable, because every human being goes through the things that these guys talk about. It's very general and I think thats another reason why they have such a wide fan base. In my opinion, good lyrics is all about keeping it real, and speaking your mind. That's what these guys do - I feel these guys arn't faking anything, like rappers do.Some of beats on here are quite tight as well. \"Faint\" is my favorite track, leaning towards the hip-hop side. The DJ work on this CD is well thought-out. Linkin Park's DJ is good. The guitar is extremly basic, so metal heads will automatically dis-miss the guitar work, because it sounds nothing like Adam Jones or Tom Morello. Shame. Complexity shouldn't mean anything anymore. Music should be appealing to the ears, and Linkin Park does this (8 million ears listened, that IS appealing) So if this includes simple guitar riffs and strums, so be it.All in all, I don't think Linkin Park is the best thing in Rock today, but they are certainly NOT this \"horrible, corporate, mainstream, MTV, teen popin' band\" that some of these people make them out to be.

In terms of raw energy, the YYYs certainy exemplify the garage punk sound on their debut album. It's 37 minutes of pure, unadulterated energy, wild vocals, and abrasive artsiness.Vocalist Karen O, guitarist Nick Zinner and drummer Brian Chase are explosive together; nothing better, nothing worse. Songs like &quot;Rich,&quot; &quot;Date w/ the Night,&quot; and &quot;Black Tongue&quot; show punk rock's fury in its amalgam of simple yet ear-shattering music and Karen O's frenzied vocals. Those songs are loud enough, but other songs like &quot;Tick&quot; and &quot;Pin&quot; are only more manic. However, the YYY's have not created a soind all of their own, for in some parts they rehash what proto-punk icons the New York Dolls and the Stooges (or some of Iggy Pop's solo work) have already done, as well as the attitude of &quot;riot-grrl&quot;bands like Bikini Kill and Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon. Unfortunately, Karen O also is sometimes labelled as rock's leading woman. True, she is not Avril Lavigne (thankfully), but she also has quite a ways to go before she reaches the level of Patti Smith, or even Mia Zapata. Despite the lack of total originality, the YYY's express their more admirable artistic side on the final 3 songs, starting with the minor hit &quot;Maps.&quot; Karen O's vocals are softer and more emotional, expressing a vulnerable side to her fiery presence, and even more introspective lyrics (&quot;Wait, they don't love you like I love you&quot;), and the final song &quot;Modern Romance&quot; is a slow art-punk dirge.Fever to Tell is an adequate debut for the YYY's, and while it breaks no new ground and suffers from being overhyped, and while it surrounds itself in occasional styles and trademarks of past artists and styles, the YYY's do keep today's rather bland and processed musical landscape energetic.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Adequate but Overhyped", "unixReviewTime": 1079568000, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2004"}

When compared to her debut's lead single \"Foolish\", you can see how much Ashanti has matured over the past 2 years. While the only track worth listening to on her debut was \"Baby\", that is definetly not the case on this record. She shows shes fed up on \"Carry On\" as well as touching on her sensitive side with tracks such as \"Sweet Baby \" & \"Rain on Me.\"The album's highlight is \"The Story of 2\", an infectious Motown influenced ballad, reminiscent of \"Loving You\", the hidden bonus track on Alicia Keys' debut Songs in a Minor. Another standout is \"I Found Loving\" which reminds me of a 1980's style smash. The album's biggest disappointment is the ridiculous interludes that do nothing but ruin the flow of the album.Ashanti proves that she has the vocal power, the staying power and the diva power to become one of the greatest artists in our generation.

They have always been innovative, creative, and gone against the downward spiral that hip hop has been taking over the past few years.  When I heard about the concept of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, I thought it was an excellent idea.  Andre 3000 is one of the most underrated RAPPERS in hip hop, and Big Boi's is also very talented.  Saying this, I have never been more disappointed in an album, ever.Speakerboxxx is a decent album, but much less than I expected from Big Boi.  I always thought he was capable of dropping a classic album by himself, but unfortunately he proves that he can't.  After the masterful, socially conscious undertones that rules much of SouthernPlayalistic, I thought he would come up with something a little better than War, which is just an uninspired rant.  That song encompasses my entire feeling of Speakerboxxx: it had the foundation, but the ideas never came out as excellent songs.  Ghettomusik has the same kind of beat that made B.O.B. a classic, but lyrically it's just boring.  Tomb Of the Boom makes me feel as if I'm listening to any other southern rap record released in the past couple years.  There are some strong moments on Speakerboxxx, though.  &quot;The Way You Move&quot; is the way that the entire album should have been done:  Laid back with a pinch of Outkast soul.  Unwell, Knowing, and a track featuring Jay-Z and Killer Mike are the highlights of this disc.The Love Below is where the album just falls apart.  As much as I'd love to say that I just don't understand Andre's disc, or that I don't like this kind of music so I can't really judge it, it's simply not true.  The music he is TRYING to make is the music I love.  Funk, Soul, with a little jazz thrown in for good measure.  Unfortunately Andre just seems to be trying to be weirder than he really is.  Hey Ya is meant to be a TRL crowd pleaser, but actually ends up being extremely catchy.  Happy Valentines' Day works, and Take Off Your Cool is absolutely stunning.  But the rest is just too strange, and Dre just does not have the voice to pull something like this off.  You'll have to struggle to get through songs like Love Hater, and the beat and hook for Spread is so unbearable that you can't get through it without reaching for the skip button.  By the time you get to the excellent A Life In the Day of Andre (where he finally RAPS), you're ready to just burn the couple good songs onto the end of Speakerboxxx and throw The Love Below out the window.In the end, this is just a poorly executed album.  Maybe Andre just needed to get this kind of album out of his system, and now he can go back to doing what he does best:  being the best MC in the greatest rap group ever.Speakerboxxx:  3.5 out of 5The Love Below:  2 out of 5", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good idea... pulled off poorly", "unixReviewTime": 1064361600, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2003"}

The more interesting of the two discs, &quot;The Love Below&quot;, is an eclectic mix of musical styles, from hip hop, r&amp;b to jazz. Andre tests the borders of his musical genre, but only to moderate success, as it seems the songs are focused on the music as opposed to the words and rapping.

Nobody... ok just checking. With Clay Aiken (last season's runner-up) heavily dominating the charts, america's 'velvet teddy bear' became old news and kept suprisingly quiet after his controversial win. Now that he has surfaced again, its clear that he should have kept quite. The album's miserable first single &quot;Sorry 2004&quot; has generated absolutely no following what-so-ever, never mind radio airplay.Ruben's main problem is that instead of following in the foot steps of the traditional American Idol contestants and attacking the pop market, he has decided to switch it up and take a swing at the RnB side of the industry. While its always wise to blaze one's own trails, its beyond foolish to entire a genre of music where every male artist sounds exactly the same, literally. One listen to &quot;Sorry 2004&quot; on the radio and you'll never know its Ruben, because it could have been Tyrese, Avant, Dave Hollister, Ginuwine or Case.His hopes of becoming the next Luther Vandross are slim to none. Had it not been for Justin Guarini, Soulful would easily be the worst AI spin off yet.

Kelis&#65533; debut album was the masterpiece belonging to music gurus the Neptunes.  It managed to crack the market with the angry &#65533;Caught Out There,&#65533; but then disappeared with the &#65533;Good Stuff,&#65533; a track so simple it is striking.Kelis then vanished from the American charts but was greatly appreciated across the Atlantic by her British fans.  Her second effort, Wanderland, didn&#65533;t fair too well commercially, but soared sonically.  Before the Neptunes become the hot-shot producers that they are now, Kelis&#65533; first two albums were workshops for the masterminds to carve out beats that are experimental yet catchy.  There is not one track on her previous albums that does not have its moment.  They all came with attitude and spunk, which made her albums somewhat universal in the sense that the songs can be celebratory and relaxed at the same time.Now Kelis wants to crack music&#65533;s biggest market &#65533; the United States of America &#65533; and in the process, she has compromised some of her best assets.  The proof is the lead single &#65533;Milkshake,&#65533; which is a mix of assorted bland beats and an attempt at sounding sexy.  It did the job, however &#65533; &#65533;Milkshake&#65533; currently sits at number three on the Billboard Hot 100.  The album is not mediocre, yet in comparison to her past work, it&#65533;s not a standout either.  It seems that even the producers of the album noticed the missing slot, which they fixed by using a track called &#65533;Flashback&#65533; from Kelis&#65533; previous album.  Moreover, it is one of the best tracks on Tasty.&#65533;In Public&#65533; and &#65533;Trick Me&#65533; are both satisfying treats that stick to the Kelis songbook.  The songs are strong, but not as catchy as demonstrated in &#65533;Stick Up&#65533; and &#65533;Rolling Through the Hood.&#65533;There is a track that sounds like a b-side from Outkast&#65533;s &#65533;Speakertboxxx/The Love Blow,&#65533; titled &#65533;Millionaire.&#65533;  Also, &#65533;Glow&#65533; is probably the weakest Kelis song ever.However, fans do have something to satisfy their wait.  &#65533;Sugar Honey Iced Tea&#65533; is definitely tasty and &#65533;Protect My Heart&#65533; hits home with its dazzling melody.The best way to describe Tasty is that it is first-class mediocre, which means that you are getting the average from the top of the crop.  Kelis is one of the best newbies in the music scene, and since her 2000 debut, she has managed to create solid beats with minimum fluff.  However, as can be seen from the album sleeve and the swimsuit pin-up, Kelis seems to be trying to introduce herself to a new and more mainstream audience.Her mesmerizing voice is still intact and her vocals are beautiful, not because of an impressive range, but because of the warm tone it carries.

And he sounds like he's boring himself on the acoustic version of \"Collide\" because toward the end of the song he sounds like he's yawning instead of singing.That also brings me to the ironic fact that this is another one of those albums where the bonus tracks are better that the regular tracks (see \"This Time Around\" and \"Standing In the Sun\"). Another thing is that it seems like Howie is trying to pull a Steve Winwood in that several of the 6+ minute songs are that long only because there's two to three minutes of extra music (maybe that's to make up for the average songwriting?). In fact, I pondered giving this album 2-1/2 stars because the fact that it took four years to come up with lyrics like these boggles the mind.

They rank right up there with Zeppelin, Dylan, The Beatles, The Who, the Stones, Queen and all my other favorite musicians.I loved my very first S & G cd, \"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\". Since that collection had but a mere 20 songs and had a somewhat short running time of only 64 minutes, I felt I hadn't gottent the full extent of their work. I thought I'd get a far greater view with the two cd, 31 song \"The Essential Simon & Garfunkel\". Unfortunately, I was wrong. Why? Read on for the positives and the negatives.Positives:-You do get the most well known hits from the band. \"The Sound Of Silence\", \"Homeward Bound\", \"I Am A Rock\", \"Scarbourough Fair/ Canticle\", \"Hazy Shade Of Winter\", \"The 59th Street Bridge (Feelin' Groovy)\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"The Boxer\", \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" and all the rest of the band's biggest hits are here.-A few underrated gems are included as well, such as \"Keep The Customer Satisfied\", \"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\" and \"Baby Driver\".-Good sound quality.-Affordable enough.-Easy to locate.Negatives:-As many reviewers pointed out, several of the songs are different than the original versions, most notably \"Homeward Bound\", \"The Sound Of Silence\" and \"I Am A Rock\".-Too many live versions! If they wanted to make a far more concise S & G collection that could've perhaps been definitive, they should've put the original versions.-Neither disc fills up the eighty minute time limit. Stuff like \"He Was My Brother\", \"7 O'Clock News/Silent Night\", \"Save The Life Of My Child\", \"Punky's Dilemma\", not to mention the studio versions of the live tracks, could've easily been included.-\"Old Friends\" and \"Bookends\" are separated. I've always preferred them together, like on \"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\".-Sound quality is good, but the earlier \"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\" is better IMO.Overall, this is a decent collection, but I feel that the single disc \"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\" is BY FAR a better bet. I hope to one day acquire the \"Columbia Studio Recordings\" boxed set, but until then, \"The Best Of Simon & Garfunkel\" is the best I can do.

Go buyHomeworkorDiscovery. The former pretty much transformed dance music in the 90s (and is included on several Best Of lists for electronica), while the second redefined the group's sound, resulting in more than one single that would become dance club mainstays. The point is that these guys already had a sound that meshed well with clubs. This album, however, was created -- so the title seems to suggest -- so as to \"clubify\" even more some of their best known tracks.The result is a failure.1. Ouverture: The only brand-new track, it stands out as an intro-set for the album. It's expansive, dark, and sounds just like the Daft Punk from the previous two albums, even if it's not a particularly interesting or driven song. (4*s)2. & 10. & 12. Aerodynamic: The original was a fun, energetic, uplifting tech-anthem. The first remix, by Daft Punk, isn't bad (4*s), but it pretty much sounds like the original track except three times as long with a few random samples stirred unobtrusively into the mix. The Slum Village remix is abysmal, with the original track sublimated beneath some lackadaisical and not particularly skilled rapping (1*). The final version is nothing but the original one stripped down to its basic components, the volume raised, and the time stretched way out. It's an alienating mess (2*s).3. & 7. Harder Better Faster Stronger: The original is one of their best known songs, a light-hearted industrial-style song with a beat like a piston and an unrelentingly slippery lyrical train. This album has two remixes. The first, by Neptune, is mostly atonal and distracted. It's not all that bad, but it does make the song sound a little sloppy and a lot cheesy (3*s). The second remix by Jess & Crabbe is simply bewildering. The first half sounds just like the original song if you tried to twist the beat into a mobius strip, but the second half suddenly collapses into some kind of dark digital box pop that totally neuters the song's original upbeat tempo (2*s).4. & 8. Face To Face: The original is a classic house track that, while repetitive, still has a fun, party-like backbone. It's the kind of song you can both dance and relax to. The first remix (by Cosmo Vitelli) has its moments, but in general it sounds like what you'd get when someone tries to remix a song for the first time. The rhythm of the song is awkwardly mutated and portions of the melody sound like they were hastily slapped together (2*s). The Demon remix is just as bad. It sounds like an unfinished track, as if someone started by setting up the harmonics for the background but forgot to include an actual foreground to the piece (2*s).5. Phoenix: The original I never cared that much for. It's like the shadow of a dance song. It has a catchy beat and some nice melodies, but it doesn't sound fully realized. The Basement Jaxx remix, however, sounds like a joke. It begins with just an absolutely awful sample of someone screaming and laughing the name of the song. Then Basement Jaxx (a group I normally enjoy for their rambunctiousness) basically pukes all over the song, beating it out of all recognizable shape with industrial ratchetings and oddly placed sea sounds (1*).6. Digital Love: The original is a simple club anthem with a happy sheen and a glossy feel. It's one of those dance tracks that might seem overproduced to some, but which is a guaranteed good time when it's played on the dance floor. Boris Duglosh (whoever that is) remixes it here, and I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between it and the original other than an extra three minutes of padding (3*).9. Crescendolls: The original is a sort of one-song party anthem; basically the kind of song you play just to get people to jump up and down a lot and scream. It's fun, although not particularly exceptional. Laidback's remix is not laid back at all. It is the same as the original song with the tempo cranked up a bit, spun in a circle, and then distorted into a loop. In other words, the kind of thing that really, really gets annoying after about two minutes (2*s).11. Too Long: This is the only song on Discovery that I didn't like. Its lounge sound and cheesy, candle-lit lyrics seemed out of place on that otherwise stellar album. If anything, I like Gonzales' remix here better than the original. He tones the music down to match the rest of the song, and his voice is very beautiful. Still, though, it doesn't sound like a song Daft Punk would or should write (3*s).13. One More Time: You've probably heard the original. I used to like it until it was played to death in clubs and on the radio (still is in some parts of the world). Romanthony's unplugged remix is the polar opposite of the original track, and I like it even less. The lyrics are leaned on heavily, and with a very fake-sounding passion, making the song sound like it's making fun of itself (1*).14. Something About Us: This was and still is one of my favorite Daft Punk tracks. It's a little slower than their usual fare, but it's smooth, funky, and seamless. I can't really tell much of a difference between the original and remix here, other than that this remix seems to take less time to get to the point, and so it's about a minute shorter (4*s).Overall: 2.4 stars.

I had also firmly decided that Norah Jones listeners must fit into three groups: A) those who viewed essential jazz as Harry Connick Jr., B) those who viewed essential classical music as Charlotte Church, and C) those who preferred the acoustic version of \"Layla\" to the electric.  In short: those who had left the land of rock and roll--without even realizing so, perhaps--and washed up against the soothing shores of easy listening.  I still stand by these categorical assumptions, but that doesn't mean I won't make concessions.  Jones has a warm, powerful, sometimes sultry voice, and I like the way she blends jazz with country with blues without pigeonholing herself into any of the genres.  I also like the way she usually resists oversinging; this is a woman who has unbelievable command over her voice and knows when to show restraint; this is no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey.  She has more in common with a laid-back Bonnie Raitt or a Lucinda Williams who studied voice at college.  Jones did study jazz piano at college, and the pedigree occasionly shows; there's something too calculated, too sharp about the songs here.  In fact, midway through the CD, the mind starts to wander, and by the end of the CD, the hand wants to reach for Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, for when Lucinda swears that by the time she reaches Jackson she won't miss her man, you can already see her shedded skin shriveling on the highway where she pitched it out the car window.  When Jones sings about the baby in the backseat and the father who now lives on his own and has sworn off the bottle, you want to check Jones's university transcripts to see if she enrolled in a family studies class.  Jones is young, but she is also very, very, very talented.  She'll only get better, and I'll probably eat all these words one day.

She proves that selling massive amounts of albums and getting loaded with all kinds of dubious music-awards really doesn't have anything to do with any form of musical ability, or creativity for that matter. Just like her first album, this one is also filled with drowsy, monotonous bores that should pass as 'jazzy' but calling this music jazz is a terrible insult to the genre that gave us Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Andrew Hill, McCoy Tyner, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Charles Mingus, and many more. 'That's not to say that this music is 'inoffensive'. For most people it IS inoffensive, just pleasant musical wallpaper that doesn't disturb a family dinner or an half an hour of washing the dishes, which declares the ridiculous amount of sales. For me, and thankfully many others who appreciate good music, this music IS offensive. It's mindnumbingly bland easy listening that doesn't even deserve to be labeled as music, but is seen as such, which is an insult. Yes, every song sounds exactly the same as the song before, so why do people spend their hard-earned money on this drivel? It really has some kind of brainwash-effect: after an hour of Norah Jones' easy listening-horror, you'll likely feel like all the blood is sucked right out of your body. If they're looking for something that's inoffensive yet beautiful, why not check out the pianoworks of Satie, or a collection of gorgeous jazz-ballads by Sarah Vaughan? Why does music without a heart and a soul always win from music that IS a product of love and devotion for music? Why does a talentless, lethargic and whining puppet like Norah Jones get tons of airplay for her elevator-music taken to the extreme, and is all the good music pushed to the side? Like I said; just what is wrong with the world these days. I gave up all hope that one day, popularity will be reserved for those musicians who challenge, touch and amaze us with beautiful, exciting music. I personally try not to care and will keep on discovering all the musical gems that the world -thankfully- still has to offer.

Once the title track started I was sadly proven wrong with a very corny song, this was when my rage started. Then track 3 was pretty bad too, then I finally hit a good song called 'Talk Show On Mute' which was a relief from the last two. That song may have had some wierd lyrics, but at least it had a decent tune like 'Megalomaniac', even if it wasn't as good. The next two songs after this however were basically the same ordeal that I had the displeasure of going through before. Meaning that they were just stupid and corny as hell! Basically I skipped those and so should you to avoid wasting valuable time. Then 'Pistola' came which was yet another sign of relief that I had been through with 'Talk Show On Mute'. The song was pretty good, it made me happy that the band was able to make three good songs on this mediocrity, overall it was good song, but not as good as 'Talk Show On Mute' or 'Megalomaniac'. But it wouldn't be until the thirteenth song titled 'Here In My Room' that I would hear another awesome song again, From songs 8-12 I just had to put up with a lot of poor structure and mediocre songwriting. The thirteenth track was good though, I liked it almost as much as 'Pistola'. Then 'Leech' hit and sounded completely different than I thought it would, I thought the album would end at a crappy state, but it actually ended good, 'Leech' is very good. Overall of the fourteen songs on the album five of them are good, the rest are either okay or mediocre.

PATIENCE follows that pattern quite well, which is unfortunate as it makes listening somewhat of a chore in parts.  As with his last two albums, the singer focuses too heavily on languid, almost yawn-inducing ballads--yes, they're very pretty, but so is a newly painted house, at which point a quickie nap is favorable to watching the paint dry(there's a point in there somewhere). The problem with George's later balladry(as opposed to the gorgeous \"Father Figure\" or \"One More Try\") has alot to do with melody, or maybe the lack thereof--the newer material often not only sounds dull, but lazy as far as melody and hook are concerned.  His uptempo work remains his saving grace--  witness the world-class \"Amazing\", \"Flawless\", \"Cars and Trains\", and the truly fantastic(and slightly old-school-sounding-Michael) \"Freek\".

Eminem doesn't rap much on here and it's a good thing because (1) it gives his group more chance to shine and (2) his delivery is the same in every song he's in. I used to like him for switching up his style every so often but he doesn't even do that anymore. All I'm left to do now is check out his lyrics, which are still on point but I think that Eminem's starting to wear out. He shines, though, on &quot;How Come&quot; and the lead single, &quot;My Band&quot;.Speaking of that track, the chorus goes, &quot;These chicks don't even know the name of my band.&quot; It's not that they don't know the name of it, it's the fact that we can't tell the difference between any of the other members. It's been three years and two albums and I still can't tell who's who in the group. All I know is who's the leader (Eminem) and who's the wack one (Bizarre--I can't BELIEVE I initially thought of him as a great rapper). And the only way I remember Proof is from his underground Promatic album. If you take a look at Wu-Tang Clan, each member has their own individuality. The members of D12 don't, at least it can't be seen yet. You also have to look at it from a solo rapper's perspective: he has to prove that he's different from every other rapper out there in the game, and that is what each member of this group should do.Unlike their last album though, there are some listenable and actually good songs like &quot;B***h&quot; and &quot;Loyalty&quot;, and the group doesn't resort to shock rap as much this time around (except for Bizarre; please get rid of Bizarre). Actually, Em, just get rid of everyone, keep Proof and bring in Obie Trice (who shines on &quot;Loyalty&quot;).

Very few people speak on the actual CD, rather they bash Eminem/D12 rather than telling the reader what makes the CD so bad.  I've seen reviews that gave this album 1 star because the reviewer prefers Esham instead.....or because he's a white man that hangs out with black men.....or because they're just die hard Ja Rule fans......or simply because he is who he is.  Then you have those that give this album 5 stars if for no other reason than the fact that Eminem is associated in some way (we have a word for these two extremes where I'm from: Haters or D*ck Riders).  Either way, none of these reviews are acurate and almost all of them fail to speak on the CD itself.  This album isn't anywhere close to 5 stars, but it's not deserving of a 1 star either.  \"D12 World\" is typical pop rap.  Anyone that bought this album in search of anything else was a fool to begin with.  The CD opens with Eminem spitting rhymes that would be ultra tight if they came from someone else, but Eminem (who has always been tight to me up until this point) has lost some steam and on this album it starts to show.  I'll speak about the other group members, but as we all know....they don't really matter.  Bizarre manages to bring the rating of this album down 2 stars all by himself.  If you want some decent rhymes from someone other than Eminem, look for Kon Artis or Proof.  Those two should break camp and start doing some solo stuff.  There are tracks produced by Kanye West and Lil' Jon (who supplied a VERY weak beat for the \"40 Oz.\" single), but for the most part, Eminem handles the production work and most of his beats sound the same.  Don't get me wrong, I like his beats, but they can get REALLY repetitive.  Most of the songs are VERY long and tend to be on the boring side.  A perfect example would be \"Loyalty\" feat. Obie Trice.  I love the beat and some of the lyrics are hot, but it's kind of long (5:54).  If you strip this entire album of all the beats and just listened to the lyrics, you'd actually have a pretty wack album on your hands. The beats aren't really that tight either.  And having Eminem perform every hook can be a bit tiresome.  But on a positive note, it's a progression from the last album in the sense that they're not trying to \"out gross\" or \"out shock\" each other on this album like they were doing on the last LP.  Overall, this is a middle of the road album.  Like I said before, it's typical pop rap.  If you expected something other than that, then the joke is on you.  Pop heads will love it, but heads like me that want skills and substance are better off searching the underground for quality hip hop because there is none on this album.  I would reccommend downloading this album instead of actually buying it though.  Come to think of it, I would NEVER reccommend buying any album that has Bizarre rapping on it.  He has NO SKILLS at all.  But that's just my opinion.  In my mind, if Eminem had never blown up like he did, you'd never hear from these guys (well maybe you'd hear from Proof and Kon Artis).  This is a perfect example of how having a famous homie can get you a record deal instead of landing a deal with actual skills.

He ditches this formula when rapping with D12, however, joining the rest of the group in rapping about \".44s,\" \"b-----s\" and domestic violence, without irony.That said, the group's sophomore effort, \"D12 World,\" is a well-crafted if mostly forgettable album. All of the group's members prove themselves competent lyricists, again disproving any conception that their success is due only to Eminem's coattails.Stupidly, the album starts off with its weakest track, \"Git Up;\" surprisingly, the downright bad song is courtesy of the group's star. It's set to the incredibly grating tune of \"The Name Game\" (\"Anna banna bo banna,\" or however it goes). Enough said.The CD improves rapidly from there, however.By far, the album's standout track is the first single, \"My Band.\" Though it gets annoying with repeated listens, it provides a tongue-in-cheek take on Eminem's preeminence in the group. Against a fake teen-pop beat, the band rebels against the \"lead singer,\" who gets more than his fair share of women and luxuries on tour.Another song worthy of mention is \"How Come,\" a song about growing away from a longtime girlfriend. Though both the lyrics and melody of the chorus could have used some reworking, it remains a powerful track.Other than these tracks, most of the CD mindlessly if artistically blows off testosterone, in the forms of drunken rabble-rousing (\"40 Oz.\"), womanizing (\"I'll be Damned\"), misogyny (\"B----\") and aimless violence (\"Get my Gun,\" \"American Psycho II\").Occasionally, these themes are woven together in a somewhat-worthwhile manner. For example, \"Just Like U\" is about the problem of raising a child while publicly advocating demented behavior. It's something of a re-write of Eminem's \"Role Model,\" but with a more focused and personal angle.Among the most stomach-turning lines: \"You're my son / I'm trying to teach you something / You're e(halfheartedly censored)ght years old? / It's time to start f----n'.\" Disturbingly enough, children's voices are used in the chorus, a la Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2).\"At the end of the record, listeners are left satisfied if not ecstatic with their purchase.

But this record here sir, this is strike three, your third crappy record in a row, and I'm afraid to say that I've about had it. We all remember how \"Wild Mood Swings\" was one of the most unlistenable piece of garbage ever, and its followup, \"Bloodflowers\" was a feeble and uninspired attempt to stay relevant in the face of nu-metal.But somehow fortune has shined its good graces on you and you are now an elderstatesman of alternative rock, and why not celebrate with a new record? One that shows your position is justified. One that shows the world the Cure still have it and can still write amazing tunes. But it seems that while your weist line has expanded to monolithic proportions, your work ethic has greatly declined, being that there is not one decent, memorable moment on this whole record.Let's take your lead off track, \"Lost\" for example. Built around the ugliest, most redundant riff ever, you wail off key while this version of the Cure tries desperatly to keep up. This track sounds as though you are ripping off a Cure cover band. As the record progresses over the next eleven tracks, this didn't seem to be a throwaway track either. It was a mission statement. A mission statement of sucking.Through the entire course of the record the lyrics are border line retarded, the guitars sound out of tune, and that ungodly wail that you proclaim to be your singing voice now is so hideously off key that I needed an asprin to finish the remainder of the record(somthing simiular to my \"Wild Mood Swings\" experince).Sure, all right, \"Anniversary\" is all right, but for the life of me I remember absolutley nothing about it now. There are no memorable melodies over the course of this sad excuse of a record.The guitars and vocals are too high in the mix, the keyboards almost non-existant. And, a question I have to ask: where is Simon \"Elvis\" Gallup? His melodic bass lines where the driving parts of many of your best songs, but here he seems sadly M.I.A. Was he at the pub trying to numb himself after hearing this schlock replayed over the studio moniters?It reads in the booklet that this record was recorded in the Spring of 2004 and released a mere two to three months later. And that's exactly how it feels. It feels as though this record was written and recorded in a weekend to capatilize on your new hipness. But I don't buy it. I recomend to you that you take a listen to your back catalog to remember what made the Cure a great band in the first place: atmosphere, melody, heart, emotional vocals that never over took the songs.

The group has changed since its last album, tragically losing its most established and in my opinion most talented artist Big Pun (R.I.P.). The other change is two original members Cuban Link and Triple Seis have parted ways and are pursuing solo careers. In Cuban Link's case there is bad blood between him and Fat Joe as most people who follow the group know. The group now consists of four original members Fat Joe, Armageaddon, Prospect, Tony Sunshine and one new addition in female MC Remy Martin.The album opens with Terror Squad leader Fat Joe letting it be known Terror Squad is still holding it down on &quot;Nothings Gonna to Stop Me&quot;, singer Tony Sunshine drops in halfway and in a role reversal, Sunshine rhymes while Fat Joe drops a chorus. Remy Martin who has made a name for herself through winning some battles leads the way on &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; and &quot;Hum Drum&quot;. Fat Joe and Remy Martin hook up again for the lead single &quot;Lean Back&quot; which has become a summertime anthem that has been exploding on the radio for weeks, its a catchy track that is bound to help the squad sell units. This track has spun off a number of remixes and has more on the way. Tony Sunshine then tones things down and adds diversity to the album with two laidback R & B tracks &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Streets of NY&quot; feat. Remy Martin. Big Pun is resurrected on &quot;Bring Em Back&quot;. I am not impressed by &quot;Yes Dem to Def&quot; which states Fat Joe as &quot;the true king of New York&quot;, and has Joe rhyming with a poor Jay-Z imitation like flow. Thankfully Armageaddon drops &quot;Pass Away&quot; which is easily my favourite track on this release. Delivering introspective lyrics Geddy brings mad depth on this cut, backed by a sick beat and some smooth Tony Sunshine vocals this is a track to remember. Gotta say Armageaddon is now my favourite TS MC, and I hope to see a solo album out from him in future. The next track is the pounding &quot;Let Them Things Go&quot;, not really feeling it. Prospect gets his chance to shine on &quot;Thunder in the Air&quot; and then &quot;Terror Era&quot; closes things off.Overall this is a decent album, its good to see Terror Squad back at it.

Until now, however, any excursion into Cohen's shadowy world has always been worth the ride. Cohen is too meticulous a craftsman ever to release a truly mediocre album, but \"Dear Heather\" suffers from a distinct absence of heft. Although they are undeniably well-made, the songs and poems presented here seem to lack importance; none force you, as listener, to live more vividly in the world; none enrich your experience, in the way that early songs such as \"Suzanne\" and \"Famous Blue Raincoat\" did.

The sound is not massively changed, but the processional opener 'Next Exit' sets a new mood for the band. The brilliant 'Evil' matches an angular verse with an impassioned call of an upbeat chorus, while first single 'Slow Hands' boast an almost disco-ish beat and is the most compact pop song here. Best of all, though, is 'Not Evil Jail', which rides along on an aggressive, relentless beat into a gorgeously atmospheric verse, into a simple guitar riff which sounds like The Strokes meeting Joy Division, into a beautiful, surprisingly major-chord chorus: the perfect distillation of what is dark yet beautiful. They're not always so consistent: 'Public Pervert' and 'Length of Love' are very much Interpol-by-numbers with no real tunes to speak of.

Feel the strength of this album on it's own merits before your woman cops this and, like the first album, wears it out on your ears from repeated play so much that's its beauty is lost and you entertain thoughts of hiding it from her under cushions in the couch. It's one thing for an artist like Scott to come out of nowhere, as was the case the first time, but this time, I was ready.No jaw-dropping at the confidence an obvious newcomer brought to the mike, no cursing under my breath at lyrics that I as a poet, had wished I had written. No more confusion about how even her jazzy-like playfulness had more depth than the ire or sex appeal of so many other contemporary female artists.It's one thing to write all this &uuml;ber-conscious, psuedo-witty commentary on what's missing in our music. It's a whole `nother thing when someone sits a lot of what's missing in your lap out of nowhere. So this time, I was ready. Or so I thought.\"Beautifully Human\" disarms immediately with the childhood picture of herself on the CD's cover, a stark contrast from the secretive, fedora-covered shot of her on \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. 1.\" and the understated image of her on \"Experience: Jill Scott 826\" live CD. Concerning the issue of who black artists should be beholden to, poet Langston Hughes stated in his 1926 essay \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\" that \"no great poet has ever been afraid of being himself. We know we are beautiful.\" Hughes concludes, almost proudly, that we are also \"ugly too.\" Scott has taken this to the next level. To her, we are beautiful all the time - even when we're dead wrong and ungodly.Philly's queen regnant appears to be willing to share more of herself than before. \"I am not Afraid\" sounds like a young, black female waiting to be whatever it is that a brother is looking for, be it a lewd party favor in his videos, the laid back girl he settles down with when it all gets old, or whatever in between. \"Golden\" seems almost too obvious to be profound; live life like its precious. It definitely didn't hurt to be reminded though.\"The Fact is\" is by far one of the most courageous songs by a black woman in years. After years of the neck-rolling rhetoric of women quick to tell everyone how they can do everything by themselves, and men seething in an almost violent indifference, the virtual standstill we find in relationships of a people touted at the conscience and \"soul\" of America has amounted to love meaning goin' \"half on a baby\" and frankly, a generation of the woefully selfish, spiritually-devoid. Scott lays the real out across a quietly-arranged fabric of harps and acoustic guitars. \"I need you\", Scott delicately pleads. The amazement of the wide range of her career options, income and ability to kill that ugly spider over the bed in her single apartment has not eased the fact that she as a woman, needs a man in her life. Not want. Not could use. None of the those safe, plastic terms of protection. Co-dependency be damned, she doesn't stop there:\"I can even raise the child we'll make/ Make sure he's loved and knows what God gave us/ I can teach him how to walk and stand but I need you to help him be a man/ We need you/ so hard to say\"\"Spring Summer Feeling\" keeps the same laid back almost completely acoustic feel. Here Scott appears to be channeling your everyday sistah as a brother turns up the heat of his rap. The sistah's feeling him and letting it be known that his success is largely due to the fact that his game is not centered around jewelry and money. \"Cross My Mind\" is that ode everyone has to the one that introduced you to yourself sexually like no other. So much so that you try to have the next one wear the same perfume or do the same moves, but it just don't smell or feel the same. Funny how that one always tends to get away. It could be largely because, as Scott admits at the brink of calling this blast from the past up and getting herself into some trouble, \"you were never good for me and/ I was never good for you.\"\"Bedda at Home\" has the funkiest edge on the CD, a sitting at the bar of a poetry caf&eacute; feel. This is where you imagine Scott to be as she croons to someone passing by and catching her eye: \"You're the kind that turns my head and makes me look/ You're the kind that makes me pull single dollars out my pocketbook.... And I know you'll think this is crazy/But/ I got somethin' better at home\" And she ends the song coming home to her man (mildly hot and bothered by the dude from the club we can conclude), singing assurances of her fidelity with a gut-busting abandon reminiscent of \"It's Love\" from \"Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. 1.\" It's an abandon you'll tend to miss in this primarily meditative, slow-tempo CD. To hear her cut loose here lets you know it's not about being cool when it's love.\"Talk To Me\" in mid-song, boldly dabbles with swing. The bubbling aggravation Scott has for her uncommunicative man switches gears into the big band sound, It comes off so playful and relaxing that you as a listener can imagine putting down the remote and turning the game off (okay, I'm trippin' at least muting it) to see what's up.\"Family Reunion\" is a gem of the dysfunctional and functional in all our families. Each and every character, from uncle Dave at the grill, to drunk aunt Juicy to kind-hearted uncle Jerome, makes you warm inside. You'll sit there and enjoy watching your kinfolk chuckle at themselves listening to this and asking who Jill Scott is. \"Can't Explain\" states what few women fess up to; cheating on a good man for no good reason. Cheating with no exaggerated father figure issue, drinking binge or over-dramatized Lifetime Channel past relationships residue as justification. Although Scott is unable to explain why it went down like that, the fact that she does not hide behind excuses is commendable.Scott attempts to ease the disgust she senses in this mistreated lover from the past with an apt analogy: \"if you have a nightmare, do you stop dreaming?\" Brothers: Imagine the wound too wide for stitches after the one that made it came at us afterwards with balm like this. Playwright and philosopher Remy de Gourmont alleges that, \"Most men who rail against women are railing at one woman only.\" Scott attempts to address the hurt in us instead of dismissing it, attempting to free us from that camouflaged rage, one listener at a time.The queen, restless round the way girl, the devoted, the tempted good girl, cheater, reflective relative, career woman... Scott captures them all at their most vulnerable, honest, imperfect and yet most powerful moments. And it is, beautiful.

That's probably because he's spending his free moments working with his new prot&eacute;g&eacute; John Legend. It may have seemed like Legend came out of thin air, but he has been working towards this moment for years, polishing his piano skills since early childhood. He has also made a name for himself by lending his talents to artists such as Twista (\"Overnight Celebrity\"), Janet Jackson (\"I Want You\"), Alicia Keys (\"You Don't Know My Name\"), and many more. John is finally ready for the big time, releasing his own album with production assistance from long-time mentor Kanye.The album begins with Legend gracefully stroking the keys and crooning a heartfelt introduction to the album in the premier song \"Let's Get Lifted.\" Throughout the album, he mainly sticks with his R&B; roots, but branches out as much as he can inside of those restrictions. On such tracks as \"Used to Love U\" and \"Number One,\" listeners get a chance to hear Legend's use of piano and vocal skill soar over the top of some soulful backgrounds produced by West. \"Alright\" seems to be what Tweet was trying to achieve with her song \"Call Me\" while \"She Don't Have to Know\" proves early on in the album that Legend can produce a great song without the watchful eye of West. After an appearance from Snoop Dogg on \"I Can Change,\" the album dramatically slows down and features its star stroking the keys with little distraction.The lyrics of Get Lifted are also worth a mention. Unlike today's popular hip-hop and R&B; which consist mainly of tales of people falling in love, fondling women, and/or how one can waste their money, Legend speaks of so much more. In his song \"She Don't Have to Know,\" the lyrics tell of what happens when one takes an interest in someone that is already taken, while \"Refuge\" talks about finding comfort with loved ones. \"Ordinary People\" and \"Stay with You\" seem more like songs one would hear from one amazing Baptist pianist performing secular music. Overall, \"Stay with You,\" \"Let's Get Lifted Again,\" \"So High,\" and \"Refuge (When It's Cold Outside)\" are rather forgettable, bu the track that follows \"It Don't Have to Change\" really contrasts those previously mentioned songs with Legend's piano and entire family backing him, stating, \"Times is hard and things are a-changing/ I pray to God that things can remain the same/ All I'm tryin to say is our love don't have to change.\" Then, Legend gives listeners one last surprise as he switches gears once again on the album's final track \"Live It Up\" featuring some `90s bass and hip-hop's newest violinist Miri Ben-Ari (most noteworthy for her appearance in Twista's \"Overnight Celebrity\").Overall, Get Lifted takes one back to the soulful and poignant days of Motown, yet still remains current with production from West. It seems as though Legend's intent of the words \"get lifted\" isn't physical or emotional, or even spiritual, but rather a culmination of the three giving listeners the soul found in \"church\" and mixing it with the vibe of today's hip-hop. Legend's style may be a bit old-fashioned, but it's something unheard of in today's pop music and is definitely worth a listen.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Does Legend do enough to get listeners lifted", "unixReviewTime": 1114041600, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2005"}

For Elton John, his artistry has been around for over 35 years, and yet he still hasn't lost his way to way sells, and what doesn't sell. His last record, Songs From The West Coast was a grand reflection of music which worked very well for the music and its videos. Yet where that made it happen so well, he tried it again, but without quite as much momentum as before.Peachtree Road, Elton's 2004 record, has more of a Southern rock style unlike his last record. The songs here range with reflection from Pop, to a little bit of a country style. The album gears it out fairly well, but not over the top. Still, the collection does include some great tracks including the first single Answer In The Sky, All That I'm Allowed, the country-styled Turn The Lights Out When You Leave, and the somber yet soulful Weight Of The World. The album also has a few disadvantages into it. Mostly, being drowned out by a few lackluster tracks like They Call Her The Cat, and My Elusive Drug that somehow lose the feeling off this record.All in all, Peachtree Road is a very fair, but not outstanding record Elton John put out. Yet, for new Elton John fans, this record is worth giving a chance at where others might want to skip this record, in favor of another Elton record.

Right now everyone would have to agree that he is the best rapper out. The Slim Shady LP was groundbreaking, the Marshall Mathers LP was controversial, and the Eminem Show was neither but it fell in an Eminem safe zone. The reason why I gave his fourth album, Encore, a 3 rating is simple.Encore has a lot of problems. First, Eminem's tone in many of the songs is very low which is not his style. On his previous three albums his menacing lyrics were piercing and loud. Another problem with Encore is the fact that Eminem gets too personal. On \"Like Toy Soldiers,\" he talks about Ja Rule, Benzino, and the beefs he had with them. He goes on and on about how he is not gonna beef with anyone which is quite annoying after a while for a guy who is supposed to be the best rapper in the industry. It seems like Eminem whines instead of rap on that song. Dr. Dre, who was sorely missed on most of the production on the Eminem Show, gave Eminem a lot of great beats to work with, but Eminem fails to deliver with the ferocious lyrics like he has in the past. An example of this is \"Mosh\" where Dre's beat is incredible & you think Eminem would bust out with one of the best rhymes ever heard on wax since Nas at \"Live at the Barbecue,\" but he doesn't deliver. This is a current trend throughout the album which left me scratching my head after I listened to it.Album Overview:1. Curtains Up2. Evil Deeds - Disappointing open to the album. Not as grimey as previous openings like \"Kill You\" and \"White America.\"3. Never Enough - Eminem recovers nicely on this song and it is one of my favorites. 50 Cent and Nate Dogg help out our favorite white rapper with nice cameos.4. Yellow Brick Road - One of those low tone Em songs. Gives more depth about Marshall's past which gives you an interesting listen.5. Like Toy Soldiers - I expressed my opinion about this song in the above paragraph. America loves to promote songs about Eminem's personal demons (see \"Cleanin Out My Closet\" and \"The Way I Am\") but they are going to be pressed with that kind of material that can be a good single on this album.6. Mosh - I was really disappointed with this track. Dre's beat is menacing, but Eminem fumbles with his lyrics.7. Puke - Sigh..........this is one of the skippable tracks on the album. The song is about Kim and the beat is irritating.8. My 1st Single -  This song is alright......but it seems to have no direction just like a certain other song on this album (you'll see in a bit).9. Paul (Skit)10. Rain Man - Talks about Christopher Reeves and Eminem has a line at the end that says \"I don't gotta make no god damn sense / I just did a whole song and I didn't say [...].\" My point exactly about this album.11. Big Weenie - This song is just plain silly. This is supposed to be a song that takes shots at all of his critics but it's ridiculous and skippable.12. Em Calls Paul (Skit)13. Just Lose It - Not much to say. You've heard it already. You've seen the video. Case closed.14. A** Like That - Talks about the Olsen Twins, Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, and other women he would like to be with. Just plain ridiculous. Can you say.....filler?15. Spend Some Time - Obie Trice and 50 Cent helps out Em on this track about trifling women. One of the better songs on the album.16. Mockingbird - He is talking to his daughter and his niece about why everything is the way it is and everything is going to be alright someday. Good idea........bad execution.17. Crazy In Love - You have to have an acquired taste for this one. It's definitely skippable for me.18. One Shot 2 Shot - D12 makes a nice cameo here. One of my favorites.19. Final Thought (Skit)20. Encore/Curtains Down - Great way to send off the album with Dr. Dre, Eminem, and 50 Cent collaborating to create an anthem that will tear the club up. I wish he could've had more songs like this on the album.Overall I would have to say that Eminem, even when half-trying, can still release a satisfying album. Encore is just part two of the Eminem Show's depression trip. Eminem's first two albums were hardcore and gritty and his last two have been laid back and depressing. That technique worked with the Eminem Show but not Encore. Em, just go back to the hardcore stuff we know and love.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Eminem Fumbles with Encore", "unixReviewTime": 1104105600, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2004"}

I should've known that Em changed on D12 World, but I didn't want to believe it. Eminem Show and Slim Shady LP were great, and Marshall Mathers LP was classic, but this album is no comparison to them. Not only is he confused about Kim, which loses you throughout the CD, but he tries too hard to make fun of people anymore.I hate Michael Jackson more than most, but saying stuff about him for publicity is no better than actually doing what Michael did. And he addresses the subject very immaturely on the two skits based on it. In his first album, he was immature. And we loved him for it, but then he seemed to grow up on The Marshall Mathers LP. He had deep songs like \"Stan\" and \"The Way I Am\". That album, in my eyes, is a rap classic. On The Eminem show, he didn't seem to be able to top Marshall Mathers LP, but he was just as good. He seemed to have been growing up.On his latest album, he took 5 steps back. Besides the exception of \"Encore\", \"Mosh\", \"Like Toy Soldiers\", and \"Mockinbird\", all of his songs are pretty much alike. They all make very little sense, and he take hits at so many people who never did anything to him. It was funny when Em dissed the boy bands, but it's just not anymore. Eminem sold out to Hip-Pop(No, that's not a spelling era).If you're an Eminem fan, you'll probably be dissapointed. And if you're not, strangely, you'll probably like the album.

Gribble", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewText": "Aside from a couple of shining moments, you're crazy if you've ever thought 50 was lyrically that good. His success is mainly due to his style/swagger, stellar beats, and undeniable hooks. Not like I'm trying to take anything away from him, but if you're expecting a whole lot of solid rhymes, let alone ones that don't involve guns & sex, 50 never has nor will be the place to go. He hasn't changed a whole lot in two years, but is he still doing it as good as he has?\"In My Hood\" gets the album off to a solid start, it's a typical 50 Cent hood song and has a great beat by C. Styles & Bang Out. Overall it's good, but it's nothing special (although the Saxophone part that closes the track is real nice). \"This Is 50\" has a pretty grimy beat, but 50's drawl at the end of every line seems all too formulaic, taking a page right out of \"Blood Hound\" from \"Get Rich...\". It could easily grow on the listener though. Lyrically 50 copies his previous effort again with \"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\" (aka \"Many Men\" Pt. II). That being said it's one of the better tracks on the album with Eminem's production being the perfect marriage for the 50's subject matter.\"Piggy Bank\" is Massacre's diss track, where the clunky beat won't really draw you in as much as the venom he spits at Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, & Nas. To be honest this is not a big winner, the beat's not really that great but the big thing is while he disses these rappers he doesn't really say anything remotely harmful/embarrassing/clever/whatever. All this track is gonna do is make enemies & create some buzz, but he didn't have a single diss line that was memorable at all. This is a soft diss track at best, sorry no memorable \"Back Down\" on here.Em produces and drops a verse for the great concept track \"Gatman & Robbin\". Both Mcs fit the quick paced beat quite well, Em's verse in particular will take several listens to break down.Say what you want about the `hit' \"Candy Shop\", but the Scott Storch beat is simply hypnotizing and will be in the clubs for a long time. The subject matter gets a bit old (it's basically \"Magic Stick\" Pt. II), but the masses aren't even gonna listen to the lyrics anyway.There is one serious problem you can see from reading the liner notes. While his previous effort was driven by four incredible Dr. Dre cuts, the producer's presence is greatly missed here as he only contributes two tracks. A Dre beat tends to bring out the best in 50, it did on \"Get Rich\" and the same holds true here. \"Outta Control\" is another classic shoulda-been Detox track and 50's hook comes off incredibly well, as it matches the high-pitched organs in the background. The strings and thumping bass in the background only add more intensity. While 50's verses aren't nearly as catchy as the hook, they certainly don't take away from this stellar track.For \"Get In My Car\" Hi-Tek used a slight G-funk sound too it, and accompanies typical 50 pimping rhymes. The hook definitely has the potential to be used by every guy by the end of the summer. Disco D provides the stellar beat for \"Ski Mask Way\" which sounds like the score from an old Blaxploitation film, with its creative use of an O'Jays sample. This proves to one of the best tracks on here, and 50's Kool G Rap robbin' style rhymes works better than almost any other verse on the album. It's only further complete with the great hook that's doesn't have a hint of radio play in it. \"Ski Mask Way\" is definitely 50 at his best and most respectable.50 actually shows some creativity on the concept \"A Baltimore Love Thing\". While it's not a new concept to compare Drugs with Love, 50 pulls it off quite well (to spell it out for you, he's rapping as if he were heroin). Plus it's such a huge change of pace for him it's almost a shock at first. \"Ryder Music\", while not bad, just sounds completely uninspired. It's pretty much just lazy filler, and it doesn't even fit the title very well.Dre somehow does not produce \"Disco Inferno\", instead again it's C. Styles & Bang Out. The beat and 50's hook really make this song. It's already a club hit and you either love it or hate it. Unlike that track, you can tell from the opening seconds that \"Just A Lil Bit\" is a typical Scott Storch production. 50 kicks some seductive rhymes (all too similar to \"Candy Shop\") to fit.The final Dre track only makes you want more from the two. \"Gunz Come Out\", which is your less than typical Dre track, is just that dark hard-thumping gun-talk track that worked so well for \"Heat\". Slow horns play throughout that sound like a processional march and pounding pianos come in to compliment it. Overall it's another classic Dre & 50 track, but kinda unsatisfying knowing this is the only other spot from Dre. More of the same gun talk, comes from the high energy \"My Toy Soldier\" that you can't help but compare to \"My Buddy\" from the G-Unit album. Tony Yayo drops the all to frequent quick verse at the end of the track.\"Position of Power\" has a pretty nice piano loop, although the hook is not the best. 50's typical lyrics fit nicely with the beat and are slightly more light hearted (more of a hustler song).The album, which was carrying along pretty well, has a lot of faults towards the end.The Scott Storch \"Build You Up\" has a pretty nice beat, but the Thug Luv type track is defiantly gonna be another love it or hate it track. Jamie Foxx's chorus isn't nearly as memorable as the one for \"Slow Jams\", it basically could have been sung by any typical R&B; singer.\"God Gave Me Style\" is pretty forgettable, though some might argue his cheesy lyrics here show \"depth\" or whatever... I'm not buying it.\"So Amazing\" is SO much like a Ja Rule/Ashanti track it's sick. How could 50 possible put this song after he ripped JA for releasing this same garbage? This track is a huge disappointment, I'm not sure at all what he was thinking (nor how could Dre or Em let him put this out.)If that wasn't bad enough, the \"I Don't Need Em\" COMPLETELY jacks Ghostface's \"Metal Lungies\" on the Pretty Toney Album. Did he think that no one would notice?? I cannot believe 50 did this, considering Ghostface's album wasn't even released more than a year ago. This really leaves the album off on a sour note for a real rap fan.Both regular & collector's editions have the 'bonus' track \"Hate It Or Love it (Remix)\". The original is a great song and both the Game and 50 brought some great lyrics. Here, both 50's verses are the same, the Game's first verse is different (and actually better), the rest of G-Unit adds on a small verse, but they really sound out of place. They don't work well on the track, making this Bonus not very rewarding.Before concluding the review of the album - despite the fact it doesn't cost much more, THE COLLECTORS EDITION IS NOT ANY BETTER. You're better off saving the $5 bucks or so and skipping the nude photos included (which is really the only difference i can see).As good as this album can be at times, it equally falls flat in other areas. The album is just too long (1 hour and 17 min!), especially when it has more than it's fair share of duds. The Massacre would get some serious help if it was a bit more picky with the track selection, in paticular towards the end.Fans can expect the same from 50 lyrically for the most part, which is either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Another slight problem is you almost can't help but compare a lot of the tracks from \"Massacre\" to 50 or G-Unit's previous work, because they just sound like they fit the same formula all too well.Bottom Line: There's plenty of material on here that is good quality (from 50 Cent standards) and fans will end up loving the album because of this. Despite the fact that there are way too many weak tracks, the strengths will satisfy just as they did on \"Get Rich\", and \"Massacre\" will probably go at least 4x Platinum. This album as a whole is merely ok, because the good and bad balance out pretty evenly, but even knowing ahead of time won't stop anybody from picking up \"The Massacre\".", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "This will sell regardless of how uneven the Massacre is", "unixReviewTime": 1109808000, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2005"}

I don't know a lot about his background except how heavily involved he was with producing Vanessa Carlton's debut disc. Ron seems to be a \"music man\" one of the few left within this industry and his input definitely helped create one of the better r&b; releases this year in Keyshia Cole.  The music production on this entire disc, even on the filler tracks is stellar - as I listened, I found myself marveling at how beautifully her vocals matched the music and how originally old school/nu school the music sounds.I've seen Keyshia perform a few times and while she no doubt has talent, a little vocal training could help her better control her voice and find her perfect pitch so that she doesn't strain as often as she does. I think a lot of the Mary J. Blige comparisons come about because in interviews, Keyshia is extremely \"rough\" and could definitely use a lot of media training to soften the edges - although that shouldn't deter people from giving her music a chance, unfortunately a nasty attitude displayed too many times can turn people off of an artist.All that aside, this is a really good debut disc and an excellent representation of traditional r&b; music for the new millenium.My standout track choices:I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER - I can't get enough of this song!LOVE, I THOUGHT YOU HAD MY BACK - love the string arrangementI SHOULD HAVE CHEATEDLOVE - her vocals sound a bit scratchy but that element definitely adds to the drama of the song!WE COULD BE - pretty balladSITUATIONS - I like this song a lot, especially Chink trying real hard to channel TupacOverall I would recommend this disc to fans of r&b; and those who truly enjoy hearing new talented vocalists.

The White Stripes have made an album that is Not Great.Granted, it's not terrible either. But \"Get Behind Me Satan\" is perhaps the weakest album the Stripes have yet put out, after four albums of solid, bluesy rock'n'roll. And what is wrong with it, exactly? It feels unfinished, like a wonderful album that needs another six months to reach its potential.It opens with a dark, sludgy riff that cycles around itself several times, before Jack White's high voice slips in: \"You got a reaction/You got a reaction didn't, you?/You took a white orchid/You took a white orchid -- turned it blue...\" Then he launches off into a string of embittered snaps, telling an unnamed lover that her lips \"taste sour.\"It's followed by a grim string of tropical-tinged rock, bluesy rhythms, murky ballads and some slightly creepy country-flavoured songs. There's even a song that is played only on drums and piano, with Jack singing wistfully about dying friends, pictures, memories and so on.With that tone in mind, the White Stripes manage a few more sizzling rockers, but seem to be leaning more on the slower songs toward the end. Though they rouse up a blistering blast of rock'n'roll in \"Red Rain,\" the melancholy end to all this is the mournful \"I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet),\" with its meandering piano and sorrowful vocals.Whether you like them or not, it has to be admitted that the White Stripes have become a major force in modern rock'n'roll, to the point where other bands rip them off. Their rough, raw, bluesy sound has gotten them fans of all types, and unlike many rock groups, they actually have some decent rock (REAL rock, not pop!) to back them up.But the fact is, these songs don't really feel finished. I love that dark riff Jack plays in \"Blue Orchid,\" but he plays it constantly, without a climax or any real payoff -- it continues and ends as it began, with one simple riff. The same is true of the lyrics, which range from simplistic to wonderfully odd (\"White moon, white moon/Breaks open the tomb/Of a deserted cartoon that I wrote...\")As a result, several songs feel almost like good demos -- good listening, but not quite up to the caliber of a finished, fully-realized song. Fortunately several others -- \"Little Ghost\" and the quirky \"Nurse,\" for instance -- can combine quirky songs with some gritty musicianship.Jack sounds pretty unhappy here, without much fire in his singing, but it's replaced with an introspective intensity; Meg gets to lend her sweet, off-kilter voice to a brief interlude, urging women to listen to their mums. And they both are in good form musically, whether it's a barn-dance tune or a a mournful ballad. There's less drumming from Meg and more piano, although she does get to rock out in songs like \"Denial Twist.\"While not-good-enough-to-be-excellent White Stripes is still enjoyable rock, the Stripes weren't quite on top form in \"Get Behind Me Satan.\" A pleasant, if bittersweet listen.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Getting behind", "unixReviewTime": 1140480000, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2006"}

Sure, there are parts where Jack and Meg let loose in the cacophonous blues rock they're known for, but this time around it's been balanced out with a generous helping of songs dominated by piano. Even songs like \"The Nurse,\" which contains mostly marimba and maraca, showcases just a few blasts of insane drums and guitar. One of my favorite songs on the album, \"Little Ghost,\" is an old-time bluegrass-styled tune. Then there are songs like \"My Doorbell\" and \"The Denial Twist\" where guitar has been effectively replaced by the piano, with the keys expanding upon what the guitar would normally cover. All that aside, Get Behind Me Satan is definitely a good album. The duo's songwriting has continued to evolve quite nicely, and Meg is showing noticeable improvement as a drummer, even offering up some fairly interesting, if still simple, beats. The overall sound is well-polished without being slick, and the subtle embellishments, like odd vocal panning, instrumental flourishes and background ambience added in throughout, help the songs without being distracting.

Also, \"Straight Path\" is pretty tight and Bleek comes through on the lyrical side again.There are a few cuts on the album that should've been sent straight to the trash bin. \"Infatuated\" and \"The One\" are sort of generic and they have a \"been there done that\" feel to them. \"Smoke The Pain Away\" is the obligatory \"weed\" song. It's decent, but it suffers from a suspect hook. \"All About Me\" is pretty boring and \"Hater Free\" is straight up wack.With all things considered, this is a solid release from Bleek. It's not neccesarily out of this world, but you won't be disappointed that you bought it either. It's worth checking out. I'd also reccomend picking up Beanie's new joint.

Although Gucci Mane isn't a great rapper he's better than the majority of independent acts.

Coheed & Cambria are at the vanguard of a new movement that may finally relieve us of the shallow nu-metal practiced by meatheads who can't stop yelling about how much they hate the world and themselves. Coheed & Cambria are deep and ambitious, and that's what metal really needs right now. Meanwhile, the high-pitched operatic vocals of Claudio Sanchez (a large man who is not afraid to be sensitive), the epic compositions, and the band's imposing technical chops are surely out of the ordinary in today's hard rock landscape. These guys might just re-re-define metal back into its core strengths.However, those of us with longer attention spans will find that Coheed & Cambria are not nearly as unique as they probably seem to deep-thoughts trendsters The faster and more metallic parts of the Coheed & Cambria sound are almost completely Iron Maiden mimicry, right down to the tricky timing changes and bombastic vocal arrangements, with some mid-period Black Sabbath and early Metallica thrown in. The mid-tempo sections are heavily indebted to Pink Floyd and Rush, and the slow sections are contrived exercises in songwriting that are high on attempted significance but low on conviction. When Sanchez is singing fast and loud, he sounds almost exactly like Geddy Lee, both in the tone of his voice and his technical style, and when he's in ballad mode he's channeling the most cloying of Billy Corgan's multiple personalities. Then there's the muddled concepts behind the lyrics, which seem real ambitious at first, but show the signs of an over-thinker who never gets out of his mother's basement in order to apply his huge thoughts to real world experience.This album is still plenty of fun to listen to. I am very impressed by the sinister and emotional four-song suite (\"The Willing Well\") that closes the disc, while the faster songs show real potential for Zep-style epic drama.

From his early work with Pimp C to the pinnacle of his career with the guest appearance on Jay-Z's \"Big Pimpin\" off Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter in 1999, Bun B has seen the best and worst of times over the years.  His label woes, the incarceration of Pimp C, and his fight to stay relevant in a ever-changing Rap arena are all examples of the things that could make or break a rap career.  Politics, interruptions, and significance are the major factors that ultimately decide how far any rapper will go in the music business.  Bun B has that drive that every artist should have if they want to seriously make a living off this rap game.  He 'knuckled up' and focused on cleaning up his act, getting right with the record execs, and popping up on songs on the albums of anybody willing to trade verses with a certifiable legend.  He kept his eye on the prize, and for Bun B, that was simply doing what it took to keep the UGK name out there while Pimp C remained in jail.  He continues his push with the solo release of Trill, a culmination that everybody always wanted but ultimately only surfaced because of necessity.Trill starts off with an introduction by Rap-A-Lot's J. Prince and Bun B highlighting things like the whole New Orleans fiasco, the 'Free Pimp C' movement, and his aspirations of being the unofficial president of the South.  Right after that, he rips out a verbal assassination on \"Bun,\" and resurrects Jay-Z from \"retirement\" to join him as well as Young Jeezy and Z-Ro on the song \"Get Throwed.\"  The first single \"Draped Up\" showcases some conventional UGK-sounding grooves, along with \"What I Represent\" and \"Retaliation Is A Must.\" Anyone looking for an autobiography of Bun B can hear it on the song \"The Story\" where he details the good, the bad, and the ugly. But Bun B ventures beyond his comfort zone and does a few songs that are not typical UGK songs.  \"I'm Ballin\" featuring Jazze Pha is more radio-friendly than most anything UGK has ever done. Scarface collaborates with Bun and Young Jeezy on \"Pushin,\" an attempt to appeal to the pimps, players, and the hustlers still reppin' for the streets.Tracks like \"Git It\" with the Ying Yang Twins and the slow R&B-tinged; \"Hold U Down\" with Trey Songz, Mike Jones, and Baby leave loyal fans raising their eyebrows while the bandwagon crowd will embrace it without thinking twice about it.  \"Who Need A B\" is injected with Juvenile and Too Short's vocals along with Short Dog's production that has remained the same since Born To Mack.  It's almost a given that Ludacris offers a unexciting appearance on \"Trill Recognize Trill.\"  And the weird \"Late Night Creepin\" features a peculiar participation from Skinhead Rob and Travis Barker of the punk rock group The Transplants.  Trill is nevertheless a decent album considering Bun B had to pretty much go at it alone.

A stigmata lik that makes you wonder what you are going to do once you listen to the album.Generally, the singer just wants to get out of California, while he's still alive, yet he has a few songs to spew before he runs for cover. One of them is \"Pull The Curtains\". The beginning sounds a bit promising when Plaid drums were an intro into emo territory, all while keeping the computer blips to remind us by. Though lyrics like \"Pull the curtains on the day/Sometimes it is the only way.\" gives me hope that all the plots isn't lost within a band that would change their music with a concept. \"At My Post\", at first, akes he use of synthesizers to a good use, before starting kind of messy and lazy in attempt at space shoegazing that it diesn't even sound like they ar trying to bring lighters up or get us to support the story. The thing that keeps us going is his heavenly harmonizing, which gets lost in all different types of weird noises mixed together. In other words, I listened to this song, and very unlike a Granddady song, this song just gets boring to listen to. I thought the song was going to stop at 4:08 till it went on, leaving me a bit distraught and waiting for a few albums of instumentals. \"A Valley Son (Sparing)\" personally sounds like a Sumday B-Side that should have been the reason for buying the album. Aside from the voice from Jason Lytle, the music compliments the song wonderfully, and could possibly be the one standout of the song that we can listen through without worry. \"Cinderland\" opens up sounding like an interlude instrumental, but it breaks down into a synth-laced chillout rocker, making it an accessible standout. Now, notice I say \"accessible\" standout.\"If you are who you say you are, get up her to the bar we'll plot a plan to take down the man,\" the leader sings in \"F**k The Valley Fudge\", a piano-laced teenage sing-along. Somewhere along the line you will find out why the song ends up namechecking the likes of companies like Applebees and Chuck E. Cheese. In the middle of the song is all ambient propeller-sounding noise, that makes us wonder, \"Wha...is this over already? Well, that was one of the worst I have ever heard thus far.\" And indeed the idea of building a self-written (not to mention small) anthem about dumping commercialism and ending with approximately one whole minute of noise and asingle piano noise is just disappointing in levels we can't understand.\"Florida\" is a song in which sounds like it is trying to be punk, but to sing \"Florida\" so partly blandly and freely that it takes like the rust of blue and yellow clash, and have someone scream like a banshee doesn't quite help my interest in the song. This passage seems too hard to be an underground response as a suite to American Idiot it isn't quite funny. On the possibly last passage, \"Goodbye?\", the song ends with an acoustic passage about saying goodbye to where you are, leaving it all behind. And it sounds a bit complex on whether the song is melancholy because halfway through the song, there comes a choir out of nowhere to help close the album, as if the suspicion and hint of melancholiness was all worth the trip. And now it seems that the album is all about getting out of where you are, after having a bit of grudges and hidden good times with it.I know the cardinal rule of reviewing is to not worry about a band's changing and to just worry about the music in the now, but so far the music is just out of order. There is only a few things about this album that sounds like a passage worth going through. And a Granddaddy album is always into some order waiting to fascinate us. Yet, it turns out the diary is somewhat interesting, yet not isn't as interesting as you thought it would be. Whenever a band makes music that compliments music and lyrics and builds a high impression, and comes out with a few good songs that sounds just as good to be a score of a movie, that is pretty troubling, you know? Maybe there will come a full thought of the diary, just to change my hopes on the matter.Rating: 5.5/10", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Grandaddy: Excerpts From The Diary of Todd Zilla EP (V2)", "unixReviewTime": 1129593600, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2005"}

Because this pop sound will never suit you.Former indie-rockster Phair alienated a good chunk of her fanbase with the release of a slick pop-oriented record, self-titled, and cowritten with (hang your heads in sorrow) the Matrix. It was flashy, cheap and poorly-written, and even the catchy hooks were easily forgettable.At least the follow-up \"Somebody's Miracle\" possesses a less commercial, more enjoyable sound. Unfortunately, Phair is still missing the boat. She tries to straddle between indie-rock and pop, and ends up with a rather dull midtempo rock sound.Things start off weakly with the \"Leap of Innocence,\" a slice of guitar pop that strives for charming catchiness, but never quite manages it. That continues through most of the songs that follow, with similar countrypop riffs, drum machines and some rather tinny cycling guitars that sound like a mp3 set on repeat. There are a few that achieve catchy status, like the uneven \"Can't Get Out Of what I'm Into,\" and a few that are lower tempo in the manner of a midtempo ballad.Is \"Somebody's Miracle\" a bad album? No. Is it a good album? No. Is it a middle-of-the-road album with nothing to really distinguish it? Absolutely.At the end of the day, this album has no standout tracks and little to make you remember a riff, a tune, or a musical flourish when the songs have ended. It's powerpop without soul or originality, or even instrumentation that makes it stick out.Even more unmemorable are the lyrics. Good luck finding anything barbed, sarcastic or insightful about men, women, sex, life, relationships and anything else. Devoid of humour, these become rather cheery and optimistic, and not in a pleasant way; the style peaks in the obscenely trite \"Stars and Planets,\" where even Phair seems to be uncomfortable with how silly she sounds.\"Somebody's Miracle\" is also hampered by Phair's vocals -- they're nasal and have a limited range. This is painfully obvious in songs like \"Count on My Love,\" where she tries hard to soar vocally, but can only manage a loud drone. A good singer knows her vocal limitations and works around them, but Phair isn't doing that.After her lambasting for \"going commercial,\" Liz Phair tries to satisfy everyone with her middle-of-the-road pop-rock.

I also understand that crafting a greatest hits album is never an easy task. Everyone has their personal favorites and not every good track can make the final cut.The thing is, greatest hits albums are designed for the casual fan. For someone who likes the artist's music, but doesn't want to shell out the cash for all the albums. So, the question in determining whether or not you have a winning compilation is not would it satisfy the hardcore fans, but would it satisfy someone who just wants the best of the best. This \"best of\" collection would not.If the album had been titled, \"The Best of Snoop Dogg's No Limit Years\" or \"Snoop Dogg: 1998-2002\", I think I would take less issue with it's release. But the fact is, this title is just misleading to the customer. Snoop's \"biggest\" hits almost all came from his Death Row days but you won't find \"What's My Name?\", \"Gin & Juice\" or \"Doggy Dogg World\" here. Hell, even \"My Heart Goes Boom,\" one of the best cuts from the No Limit years is missing.But enough about what isn't here. Let's talk about what is here. The best song on this compilation is easily \"Beautiful\" and \"The One and Only\" is also quite good. But the Stone Cold Steve Austin Theme? What's My Name and Gin and Juice......Part II? Several other songs the casual fan hasn't even heard of?The bottom line is I don't think someone who just wants the best of Snoop's material should begin here. The prior-released Death Row's Snoop Doggy Dogg Greatest Hits offers more of Snoop's best songs, but also some uneven rarities. I would suggest a casual fan just buy a copy of \"Doggystyle.\" Honestly, it contains most of the best work Snoop has ever done and I think it might be good enough to convince you to listen to what Snoop has produced since.

This was in my opinion a mistake because India's album was great as well.  Alicia's single was the only song that I felt was deserving of a Grammy.

Seeing as how there has been a resurgence in 1980's music, the Eurythmics finally got onto the train, reissuing all eight of their studio albums from 1981 through 1999.  Along with that, they reissued their hits package.Originally there were two hits compilations: the U.S. version of 1991's \"Greatest Hits\" focusing exclusively on their U.S. singles & the U.K. version of that same set, which included the notable well-known hits, as well as the U.K. hits they racked up when their popularity declined in the late 1980's in the States.The new reissue succeeds on it's merit of offering a much more meatier (in theory) hits package. It is the first domestic States release to feature all of their well-known singles, as well as singles that were well known in the U.K..

This man has made a mockery of somebody who was a legend for his own profit. Legally binding contracts aside, if I was Wallace's mother I would have Combs sued for defamation of character.2002's Born Again was one of the most horrific releases in rap history. Recycled verses, unreleased material (for a reason none the less) and freestyles were laid over blatantly overproduced pop inspired garbage, and you guessed it Diddy stationed himself in the center of it all. The first single, Diddy was on it. The music video, Diddy was in it. The production, guest appearences, promotion, all Diddy. It was as if he was releasing a solo record.I was nervous for the release of Duets, I figured that this could potentially exonerate The Notorious B.I.G. from his thrown as the King of New York and one of rap's most influential players. I was part wrong, part right. Diddy has once again thrown himself on the first single, in the first music video, and all over the promotional campaign for this album including television interviews, radio appearences, etc. He even uses the album as a stepping stone to his own future release, so clearly done on \"Most Shady\" were Biggie doesn't EVEN APPEAR. Mind you this is a Biggie album folks.It's sad that \"Nasty Girl\" (aka \"Shake Your Tailfeather Part 2\") featuring Diddy, Nelly, Jagged Edge & Murphy Lee was released as the lead single when those honors should have unquestionably given to \"Hold Your Head\" featuring Bob Marley. The track is hauntingly powerful, one of the best hip hop records of all time. It's nearly as good as \"Runnin\", the Eminem produced Biggie / Tupac post death collaboration.Updates of \"Notorious Thugs\" [\"Spit Your Game\"] and \"Whats Beef\" [\"Whats Beef 2006\"] are very very good.

I have all of her original studio albums and \"The Breakthrough\" is a welcome addition.The truth is that Blige's songs suffer from simplistic rhymes, undoubtedly a result of the high-school-drop-out's limited vocabulary (gift idea for MJB: a thesaurus and a new rhyming dictionary).  One need be patient and forgive Blige for her overuse of the word \"lady\" or lack of metaphor application (I would have suggested the chorus of \"Baggage\" use the phrase \"baggage I carry\" instead of \"baggage in me\").  As always, MJB's lyrics are not included in the booklet.For the most part this album is more of the same from MJB; she continues to evolve, but there are no deviations from her past musical stylings (Personally, I would like for her to record some Blues, Jazz, or Rock songs).  One stand-out production is \"About You\", where producer Wil.I.am (of Black Eyed Peas, who also raps on the song) shows how use of a sample should be done: he re-constructs \"Feeling Good\" by Nina Simone and incorporates the late legend's vocals in a way that does not bite on the original recording.  (Too often use of a \"sample\" is really just stealing the beat or re-singing or re-playing the hook of a previously recorded song.)There are several collaborations, but not with well-known vocalists.  Jay-Z appears only as hypeman on \"Can't Hide from Luv\" and Rafael Saadiq only sings backing vocals on \"I Found My Everything\" (a' la his appearances on Kelis's \"Tasty\" album).  Several tracks feature Mary's alter-ego \"Brook\" (or later \"Brook Lynn\"), who is credited as a separate artist.  The slow-jam \"Alone\", her duet with Dave Young is quite good.  U2's Bono sings the first verse of \"One\", and other than some backing vocals is not heard much on the track, begging the question: ?Why didn't MJB just make her own version and sing all the vocals?The biographical \"Father in You\" may be TMI for some - or maybe too Freudian.  The career-retrospective-set-to-music, \"MJB da VIP\" surprisingly does not seem awkward amongst the other 16 tracks.  But the WORST thing about this album is that it has a \"hidden\" bonus track.  The listener must wait until the end of track 17 (\"One\") to hear the uncredited song I'll call \"Show Love\".  This is the most up-tempo and club-applicable song on the album, and sounds ready for a guest rapper to spit a few bars.  I despise these \"hidden\" tracks because if I wanted to listen to or FFWD thru one song to get to the next, I'd listen to cassettes or 8-tracks, not CDs.My favorite MJB album is still \"My Life\", but this one is on a par with \"Love & Life\" and better than \"Share My World\" or \"No More Drama\".", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "More Mary: Not Broken (or Fixed)", "unixReviewTime": 1137628800, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2006"}

To be sure, the album \"Wahtever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\" isn't a solid effort by any stretch of the imagination, and you could easily find examples of why the band doesn't deserve so much attention. But it's the songs that work that stick with you.The record opens strong with the one-two-three punch of \"The View from The Afternoon\" (bringing back a classic of rock music, the false ending), \"I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor\" (the obvious single), and \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\", before descending into interchangable and at times incomphrensible songs that seem like \"more of the same\" than anything blazingly new. It's really not until \"Riot Van\" that the album gets back on track, but I'm sure the songs inbetween have their own merits. They just don't shine compared to what follows.\"Riot Van\" is a nice change of pace from the rest of the record, and gives the band a chance to show a more reflective side than one might get from the \"laddish\" style of the previous songs. \"Red Light\" and \"Mardy Bum\" straddle the lines between this more relaxed tone and the hyper energy of the first half, and \"When the Sun Goes Down\" drops in a nod to \"Roxanne\".But it's the closer that makes the record stand out in the end (and recommendable). \"A Certain Romance\" starts off with Strokes-esque guitar riffs and a pounding drum solo that wouldn't be out of place on mid-Eighties Van Halen, then slides into a great melody that allows the singer to decry the state of music, youth, and fashion all in one take. It's easily the best song on the record, and the clever Monkeys stick it in at the end to make us, the record-buying public, wait for it.An utterly infectious tune, it'll rattle around your head for days after the first time you've heard it. Coupled with some of the heavy hitters from earlier on the album, it helps push \"Whatever People Say...\" over the top from just an interesting debut into one that's worth more than a few listens.It's hard to tell if the AMs will live up to the hype of the British press. Certainly, as previous cases suggest, it's a rough fall from the heights of critical acclaim. But based on the songs off this album that are worth several listens, I can say that it will certainly be interesting to watch them grow and develop.

Sure, you have a few here and there that TRY to come back but only fall flat on their faces like almost anybody else who's stuck in the past.  We witnessed the explosion of rap in the late 80s into the mainstream market and the rise of the West in the early 90s.  The mid 90s brought about an resurgence in the East, and by 2000 the South was starting to make moves.  Now in 2006, the South has solidified its presence to the point where the East and West are left wondering what to do next.  LL Cool J continues to reinvent himself to ride all these different waves, which can be good or bad.  You have the die-hard fans from early in his career or the Pepsi generation who've embraced his later work.  That's exactly what happens on Todd Smith, LL's 12th major release.\"It's LL and Santana\" features some mediocre lyrics from Cool James while Juelz Santana is his usual wack self.  \"Control Yourself\" featuring J. Lo attempts to bridge the old school with today and fails miserably.  \"Best Dress\" featuring Jamie Foxx sounds like a throwaway track from Jamie's Unpredictable album.  \"Preserve The Sexy\" with Teairra Mari is just as bad as his duet with J. Lo.  He changes up his flow with a little Latin flare on \"#1 Fan,\" a mistake that should never be repeated by him ever again.  And his song with the charismatic ex-con Lyfe Jennings on \"Freeze\" sounds like they should have stayed in the studio and cranked out a better version or something.Luckily LL doesn't disappoint on the rest of the album, enlisting the help of some of the best R&B; artists in recent years as well as three surprisingly good collaborations.  \"Favorite Flavor\" with Mary J. Blige is a knockout single, as well as his songs with 112 on \"Down The Aisle\" and Ginuwine on \"Ooh Wee.\"  But his best songs have to be his collaboration with newcomer Ryan Toby on \"I've Changed,\" his pairing with the highly-energetic Freeway for the rockin' cut \"What You Want,\" and his unconventional gospel track \"We're Gonna Make It\" with Mary Mary.Although there were number of lyrical potholes present, there are enough radio-friendly cuts on Todd Smith to actually promote.  This album is like most other albums in his long list of releases.  About half of the disc is good, and the rest of the songs is just a waste of time.

I say this having heard their first album. I say this having played that album on repeat for weeks. But I also say this as someone who hasn't even touched it since. \"Now Here Is Nowhere\" was an ambitious album, for sure. With that album, Secret Machines created a sound that was, in all accounts, uniquely them and tapped into the indie rock market like no one could have imagined. \"Ten Silver Drops,\" though not as risky as their first, may very well be a better album.When you pass this in the record store or your friendly neighborhood Best Buy, try your hardest not to flip the jewel case around and look at the track listing because you may be discouraged that it only has 8 silver drops (tracks). Don't fret, however, every single song on this album attempts to reach epic-proportions and, as a result, only one track clocks in at under 5 minutes.What I really like about this album is it's un-flenching thirst to rock out. There aren't really any true soft ballads on this album, or anything that will keep your head from bouncing on your way to work. It's a nice change, as \"NHIN\" really went up and down from track to track. This album is much more focused and solid. At times, you'll probably wonder if you're listening to Secret Machines because the sound is very different from their previous efforts. On \"All At Once (It's Not Important)\" for example, the lead singer's voice grinds as his emotions flare, breaking from his usually clear throated assertions. Make no mistake, Secret Machines have definitely tried to redefine themselves on this album, and it shows.In my opinion, the best track on the album is \"Daddy's In the Doldrums,\" an 8 1/2 minute epic rock track with heavy 70's rock influence, straightforward guitar solos, and enough electronic ambience to make you think you were listening to The Flaming Lips. As is usually the case with a Secret Machines song, it slowly builds to its climax, exploding into something that you saw coming, but at the same time didn't expect at all.Overall, this album is a huge accomplishment for this band. For only thier second album, they have created something that they can build their careers off of. However, with the exception of \"Daddy's In the Doldrums\" and \"I Hate Pretending\" there aren't really any songs that you'll remember and be craving more than a year from now. Though they have created a fairly solid album, it is nothing you'll be telling your kids about and nothing to really write home about. If you are a Secret Machines fan, without question pick this album up. You will most likely enjoy it. Personally, I enjoy it much more than \"Now Here Is Nowhere\" and plan on listening to it until something better comes along.Recommended for Secret Machines fans and anyone who would like to hear an Indie take on arena rock.Key Tracks:1. \"All At Once (It's Not Important)\"2. \"Daddy's In The Doldrums\"3. \"I Hate Pretending\"4. \"1,000 Seconds\"3 out of 5 Stars", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Better Album Than Their First", "unixReviewTime": 1146355200, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2006"}

As I listened to a large range of far more intelligent hip-hop, Joc seemed rather laughable in comparison; and to be completely honest, Joc is still a rather laughable character. However, I think a lot of hip-hop heads are taking that as far too much a negative. Like Young Jeezy and Mike Jones before him, Joc is a borderline horrible emcee, with enough charisma to cross-over to a commercial market. Joc is by no means a great rapper; he's struggling for average. However, he is quirky enough, and unintentionally humerous to appeal to hip-hop heads willing to listen to the music for fun.Joc dropping knowledge would be blasphemous to his record label(the man IS signed to Bad Boy, after all; a label that specializes in commercial friendly hip-hop, with the only notable exceptions being B.I.G., Shyne, and G. Dep), but what he does, he does well enough to warrant him a spot in hip-hop's current market. More skilled than the likes of the Ying Yang Twins and Dem Franchize Boyz, but not nearly as talented as T.I. or Chamillionaire, Yung Joc falls into the same category as Young Dro and Young Jeezy(many 'young' emcees[no pun intended] here, eh?) as mediocre emcees who still have the ability to, at the very least, release catchy pop-oriented rap that isn't completely fodder.Joc's the next in a long-line of coke-dealing emcees, although he's certainly no Pusha-T or Raekwon; instead, his tales of peddling are brief, and mostly focus on whatever 'glamorous' side there is to it. Beyond that, he's got cars and broads; he doesn't go any deeper than that for the most part, however, in all of this lyrical mediocrity, there are genuine flashes of potential, that show Joc may very well only be hindered by a gimmick Diddy saddled him with.The production is, for the most part, decent. Most of it is very minimalistic, but the simplicity isn't neccessarily a bad thing. Most of the beats are catchy enough not to offend, and Joc sounds at home over them. Contrary to popular belief, most of these tracks do NOT fall under the snap category; neither snap nor crunk, they possess the same 'trap' backgrounds best examplified by T.I.'s breakthrough hit in 2003, Rubberband Man, which has since become the staple for trap-rap production.I know a lot of people hate Joc, and even have good reasons for it; however, you can do worse(must I remind you that Bow Wow, Jibbs, and Webbie all still have careers?), and Joc still has genuine potential hidden underneath the corniness.

This is coming from someone that owns all three of their albums (I loved their first album).  As far as content goes, this album is a step backward from their last album (From The Roota To The Toota).  While they had a nice blend of uplifitng and typical southern songs, this album is more typical than anything else.  Are there good songs on this album?  Definitely.  Are the beats tight?  Yes they are.  What I'm saying is, the little bit of substance they exhibited on their second album has all but disappeared.  There are some good tracks to be found though.  I can't get enough of \"So What\" and \"At The Park\" because of the feel good party vibes I get from them.  \"Area Code 229\", though somewhat silly, is still catchy.  \"Blacker The Berry\" shows what Field Mob is capable of when they actually put some effort into what they do.The problem with this album is the amount of generic content.  Tracks like \"Baby Bend Over\", \"Eat 'Em Up, Beat 'Em Up\", and \"My Wheels\" (despite decent production) are the most unoriginal and lazy songs I've heard in a while (I can only take so much babbling about ridin' rims and gettin' laid).  I firmly believe that this kind of stuff is beneath them.  Just check out the awful \"Pistol Grip\".  It's a perfect example of what I'm getting at.Light Poles & Pine Trees is a solid album to me.  I still believe that Shawn Jay and Smoke have very unique and original flows, and when they get good topics and good production, that's when they REALLY shine.  They trip up when they lower themselves to do generic tracks dedicated to rims and gettin' head.  I think Field Mob can do SO MUCH BETTER and this stuff their putting out is below them.  It's kind of like when you see a prospect that you know can become an elite player, but they don't realize their potential yet, so they settle for being good instead of great.  I hear two exceptional rappers doing below average songs because they don't seem to realize that they're as good as they really are.  Maybe I'm expecting too much from them.

Furthermore, the swashbuckling \"Maneater\" (not a cover of the Hall and Oates classic) which has also gone on to hit status (#1 UK, #16 US), has an instantly memorable pop hook and will make listeners reach for the repeat button.Still, a portion of \"Loose\" leans toward the mediocre side of the spectrum. \"Do It,\" for instance, sounds like it could have come straight from Gwen Stefani's retro dance/pop 2004 solo debut, complete with cheesy lyrics and near-identical flash '80s synths, while \"Showtime\" sounds like any old flash-in-the-pan R&B; ditty.Even \"Glow\" sounds like it came straight from a machine, and \"Wait For You\" breezes in and out of consciousness without making an impression. These tracks may not be necessarily poor in quality, but they are not memorable.The tracks that work, however, are worth note. The nervous electro-pop of \"Afraid\" has humanity and heart amid its pulsating beats, while the Spanglish \"Te Busque\" finds Furtado teaming again with Latin dynamo Juanes to great success after their worldwide smash \"Fotografia\" in 2003. Furthermore, the raggaeton-infused \"No Hay Igual\" transports listeners to South America and sizzles with rhythm and gusto despite a repetitive chorus.Other tracks such as \"In God's Hands\" showcase Furtado at her most vulnerable and introspective, while \"Say It Right,\" the current single (currently #66 US) spotlights the singer/songwriter's raw passion and strength. Confidently singing \"you don't mean nothing to me at all\" in the latter's hook, no one has ever sounded more self-assured.She concludes things in a ponderous manner with \"All Good Things (Come to an End).\"Overall, \"Loose\" is a nifty pop record. It's easy to see why Furtado is basking in the spotlight after an overly long absence; she has found a way to apply what the average radio listener likes to her own sound with favorable results. Still, if the holistic feel of the record is any indication, she had best be careful not to lose what made her so endearing to listeners in the first place when it comes time to make her next.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Well-Oiled Grab Bag of Pop Confections...", "unixReviewTime": 1164499200, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2006"}

I'm a big Glassjaw fan, and I loved Decadence, so I was excited about this album, but I honestly can't get into it. I don't know why. Its not that its a bad album. It does sound pretty good and Daryls voice sounds as good as ever. But it just doesnt draw me in, and I never feel compelled to listen to it. If I want to listen to some of Daryl's music I pop in Glassjaw's \"Worship and Tribute,\" or \"Popaganda.\" Listening to it right now, I admitt that it really isn't a bad album, I can see why many are giving it 4 and 5 stars. But I can't get into it, there are only a few tracks I really like, and considering how good Daryl is on his other records, I'm going to give this one a low 3 stars, or high 2. I guess that's what happens when you set the bar that high. You do have to admitt that he has alot of talent, and this album does show another side of Daryl that we havn't seen in Glassjaw or the other Head Automatica album, so it is refreshing from that perspective.Gone are the beats and dance feeling that came with the first album, being produced by Dan the Automator (who is a genius btw). and entering its place is a much more pop album.

And really, there's no doubt of that. He's put out a couple solid albums within the past ten years. The problem I have with him? A little word called consistency. Now I know Red Light District wasn't his best album, but it has some of the best club-baggers Ludacris has yet to have. The problem was that club-baggers is all it had, and didn't have much of the solid introspective tracks that Ludacris has potiential to do. Now comes Release Therapy. Consistency problem, its almost the opposite of Red Light District. Good introspective songs and nice R&B; crossovers, but the party jams are absent tonight. Nothing but wannabes, unless you include the smash hit \"Money Maker\" into the mix. Release Therapy isn't a terrible album, but it lacks in any sort of stand out track, consistency with previous albums, or any sort of party jam that is decent other than the first single.\"Grew Up A Screw Up\" just almost sums up the release side of the album as a whole. Catchy hip-hop with a message. Now I'm not going to go on about how bland today's rhythmic is even though most of today's rhythmic completely sucks. But it's nice to hear something interesting like Luda's past-life rather than wanna-be Nellys with bling-bling (Jibbs, Chingy, Yung Joc, the list goes on). \"Mouths To Feed\" is just as solid, using very clever lyricism (\"Listen, look I gotta feed my family by all means necessary/Cause paychecks are comin up shorter than February\") and a killer slightly jazz leaning rough production to keep your attention. Ludacris also comes through with the diss record \"War With God\", to all of those who try to diss him. Even though he explains money topics, he goes as far as proving how much of a loser those diss-ets are. \"Do Your Time\" is a hate message to the justice system. Although well written, and features a good guest appearance of C-Murder, the song doesn't do much for me. The production is pretty boring and seems to take from other songs off the album, and the song suffers from a very weak chorus.Ludacris also has some R&B; leaning experiments, and for the most part come off pretty well. Like in \"Slap\", were Ludacris just seems to be having a terrible day as his best friend died, has to work a 9 to 5, and not to mention he goes into clever disses to president George W. Bush (\"President Bush could give a d--n about our a--/So I don't wanna hear s--t that he has to say\"), the Iraq war, and living in the poor. \"Runaway Love\" also takes a more R&B-leaning; direction, it even feautres queen of R&B; herself, Mary J. Blige, making a chorus appearance. The song mostly covers three different girls who have the struggle of \"growing up a screw up\", and having a life so bad they just runaway to get away from it all, while \"Freedom Of Preach\" is a message to God.But hell, that's not to say Ludacris has some solid party jams like the island-styled and jumpy Pharell-produced \"Money Maker\" which symbols the catch-phrase of late 2006, shake your money maker. As long as you don't mind expected bland lyrics as typical with party jams, this is a sure hit. But sometimes Ludacris's pimpin' songs get a bit questionable, or horrendus. \"Girls Gone Wild\" goes in that direction, and unfortunately it is a lyrical bomb (even worse when he has to say \"You feel like having sex\"). And the production of \"Girls Gone Wild\" is danceable but nothing memorable other than a cheap knockoff Neptunes beat. Another total filler is \"Ultimate Satisfaction\", which seems to sample a bit from Benny Banassi's \"Satisfaction\", only this time the beat is slower, over-synthesized, and comes out looking overdone. You know Ludacris can make good party songs, but he seems to lack production wise as well. Production, anyway you put it, is the most important part of a party song. Not catchy, things get ugly. And Ludacris starts rapping about how many records he's sold and how much money he makes. We get it, he's successful, no need to brag about it in an already questionable track. \"End Of The Night\" is even a worse offender with a boring soft guitared beat that really doesn't keep you interested, and nor do the lyrics (\"I make 'em erupt like volcanoes, you just shake and you shiver\", what?). Bobby Valentino's entrance doesn't seem to help things either, singing very off-key. And \"Woozy\" will be one of the most laughable wanna-be party songs you'll ever hear, with a repetitive piano beat that just follows on and literally compares sex to a baseball game (\"Louisville slug it hit em with a right left, its gone/till every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be on\"). Now that's what I call \"you're out\"! Other boring topics include having a ton of cash in \"Tell It Like It Is\", where Luda is basically the king of the bank. Aren't we yet tired of the boring \"I'm rich\" topic over the past years. Seems like any rapper that has a couple hit albums under their belt has to brag.Another problem is that the album never really gels well. Most of the introspective songs are good, and most of the party shakers are wannabes, and really it gives you the feeling as if half of this album was put in a vault for awhile and the other half was done in a couple of months. There's no true connection or any sort of transition in between songs like \"Money Maker\" and songs like \"Mouths To Feed\".As for Release Therapy, well, I have to be honest. It's no where near solid. Yes, there are some good tracks on here, especially the two singles \"Money Maker\" and \"Runaway Love\", and the well-written interospective cuts, and just maybe enough good tracks to buy the album, but this is all lowered from the poorly produced and boring pimpin' songs that take up about half the album. As for Release Therapy, well there's more solid therapy than release. Not a bad album, but ridiculously uneven and, more for those looking for the more lyrical side of Luda rather than beat shakers. Buy Release Therapy for the therapy, but keep The Red Light District and Chicken N Beer for the release, and hope the next album will future the good from both. 3 stars, more like a 2.75.Track Picks:\"Grew Up A Screw Up\"\"Money Maker\"\"Mouths To Feed\"\"Runaway Love\"", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good Therapy, And Not So Good Release", "unixReviewTime": 1171670400, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2007"}

It mentions Elton and Bernie teamed up with a man called Sam Brown who told them to write what they wanted to write, not write to standard or write what they think other people want them to write. Also, Elton has stated \"I made the album Blue Moves for myself\". MAN! Some singers write every note for themselves, like John Lennon. CR*P! Cat Stevens made music to turn people off (and failed), Elton my friend, time to stop worrying about what other people think of your music.In \"Captain and the kid\" we get the pre-release hype from Elton and Bernie 'This album is like \"Yellow Brick Road\" and \"Captain Fantastic\" amd \"Tumbleweed Connection\"' and says 'Fans will love it'. It's all about pleasing fans and critics.For so long, from around 'Blue Moves' to 'Big Picture', though more to the point 'Reg Strikes Back', he recieved many bad reviews and a lack of respect from fans, all these people saying \"Your best material was from 1970-1975\". He spent the 80's trying to have a big hit so he could stick it to his critics, and since the 90's he's been trying to return to his roots so he could please people. Now he's got so good at it.Every album now makes refernces to the classic period and sounds ever so country adn early 70's and sings songs about loving America (because his biggest fan base is in America, and if the Americans are happy, the rest go along with it). Just like 'This is Tumbleweed Connection all over again'.I actually like \"Peachtree Road\" because it actually is pleasingly country in a whimsical way, but this album just sounds so formulaic. Compare the other tracks to \"The Bridge\". \"Bridge\" is obviously a track straight from the heart that 'just happened'. The other tracks generally sounds pre-meditated and have predictable melodies, lyrics, etc. The highlights are \"Bridge\" and \"The house fell down\". Other than that, \"Tinderbox\" is a little bit interesting with it's hard-rock fills, and \"NYC (wouldn't have you any other way)\" has some pretty interesting backing vocals. None of the music is bad, it's just so derivative, mainly on the last ten to fifteen years.I suppose the album does have merit (esp for baby boomers) as it does take you back fairly well to the sound and mood of the seventies. I just wonder if this is a genuine return to roots, or a simple critic and fan pleasing exercise. If that's the name of the game, Elton's doing well, his last four albums (El Dorado included) have all received four stars from [...].

One of the few impressive vocalists to emerge in recent years, Fantasia can sink her teeth into a song like it's no one else's business. Even she cannot pump any life into the bargain basement compositions that weigh down her self-titled sophomore LP.Lead single \"Hood Boy\" featuring Big Boi blares out of the speakers with a sharp, scatty performance and downright catchy sampling of \"The Happening\" by the Supremes. Still, her singing that a man of six-foot-four, 225 pounds is the \"only kind of dude I'm demandin'\" not only advocates discrimination, but it directly contradicts the messages of self-worth and empowerment that follow it.The most obvious contradiction is the Diane Warren-composed \"I Feel Beautiful.\" Aside from being a perfectly average little ballad with as many clich&eacute;s as a Hallmark commercial, it states:\"You tried to make me feel worthless/Now I know I'm not/My worth is priceless/I got back my pride/I took back my life.\"Apparently, everyone is allowed to feel worthwhile - except for a man shorter than six-foot-four.Even more hypocritical are the overwhelming batch of tracks that make Fantasia sound like the spokeswoman for NOW. \"I'm Not That Type,\" \"Uneligible,\" \"Not the Way That I Do,\" \"Two Weeks Notice\" \"Baby Makin' Hips, \"Bump What Ya Friends Say\" and \"Bore Me (Yawn)\" all find her gunning to be the new age Helen Reddy. Why would a woman of such abundant independence and sense of self still employ the checklist of demands in \"Hood Boy?\"Subject matter aside, \"Fantasia\" strikes many a bland key. Bubbly ballads like \"When I See U\" and \"I Nominate U\" are only pushed to mildly entertaining levels because Fantasia is a classy, capable vocalist, better than many singers with less limited ranges - that's right Christina. Still, \"Not the Way That I Do\" suffers from obnoxious repetition and a heart attack-inducing pace, while \"Baby Makin' Hips\" is lyrically hazy. Other tracks would barely suffice as B-sides, much less album tracks.The few shining moments, however, glitter better than gold.  \"I'm Not That Type\" and \"Two Weeks Notice\" may be her best recorded performances to date. Her vocal prowess is pristine, show-stopping and completely listenable, the latter in particular. Complete with jazzy instrumentation and an exceptional backing chorus that provides a flashback to late 80's/early 90's adult contemporary ballads, it would blow her detractors to dust if it became the massive hit it should be. \"Surround U\" is also an addictive little ditty destined for the radio waves.While it is no runaway success, \"Fantasia,\" like her 2004 debut \"Free Yourself,\" is full of promise.

If you read my review for \"The Sunlandic Twins,\" I really don't have much more to add to this particular album's review...as Kevin has taken the \"band\" even deeper in to an annoying, mainstream-wannabee pop abyss. Surely however, I'd rather listen to \"Hissing Fauna...\" than anything currently being overplayed on Top 40 radio stations, but nevertheless, Of Montreal is not \"supposed to be\" a mere catchy pop \"group.\"If you've been paying attention to the Scissor Sisters for the past few years, you are probably familiar with their frequent nodding to the long-gone disco period. In fact, their latest effort, \"Ta-Dah,\" is filled with Gibb-like catchy tunes that are hard to get out of your head. By the way, they're not very good songs, mind you. They're just catchy.I bring them up because it sounds as if Kevin Barnes has annointed his once-precious Of Montreal a distant cousin (maybe sister?) to the Scissor Sisters. Virtually the entire second half of \"Hissing Fauna...\" is pretty much just one thumping version after version of the Scissor Sisters' \"The Other Side,\" which is a track from their latest. While I'm not particularly a big fan of the Sisters, I do find their disco style better represented. ...because hey, that's what they intended to do from the get-go. Listen to Of Montreal's older albums up to their fantastic \"Satanic Panic in the Attic\" album to see what I mean.Aside from the nifty packaging with more of Barnes' ever-interesting artwork, this album is just another retread of \"The Sunlandic Twins\" with even MORE of an electro-poppy groove. Unfortunately, it's neither interesting, nor truly creative. Bland for my tastes, but then again, I much prefer Of Montreal's whimsical concept album, \"Cocquelicot Asleep in the Poppies.\" Pop, yes, but not a blatant attempt to gain new listeners by way of compromising talent.If you're a brand new fan of Of Montreal and enjoyed \"...Twins,\" get this immediately.

Stone has verve and sizzle - there's no disputing the British vocalist has a uniquely talented throat. However, as on her previous releases, the ingredients don't quite jell.Like 2004's \"Mind, Body and Soul,\" the new record is weighed down by too much style and too little substance. To call Stone pretentious would be a massive understatement. As if it isn't enough that she systematically checkmarks all the soul singer clich&eacute;s, everything from her image to her album titles to her cover art reflect such an air of self-importance that each CD should come with its own gust of wind. The title sounds ripe for a debut LP - not a third major release from an established artist, and the speech intro by English footballer Vinnie Jones, \"Change,\" further attempts to convey to the listener that, yet again, Stone has thrown a curveball to her creative palette. Please.Stone's main predicament is that she sounds like an amalgamation of many of her influences, but with far less memorable material. She clearly draws upon classic singers of blues, Motown, even Tin Pan Alley - harkening memories of better, more fully-realized songs than the ones she delivers. This means that, aside from some modern flourishes and mainstream influences, she has hardly made any significant \"change\" since the last time around.Jarring lyrics spew out of Stone's mouth left and right. No matter how invested she may attempt to sound or how funky the instrumentation may be, awkward wordplay such as this verse from lead single \"Tell Me `Bout It\" simply cannot hide:\"Let's have a show of hands, who's addicted to their man?/If I could do the things I want to you, you'd be changing all your plans/You wanna say I'm yours, I wanna say get it/You wanna say, so say, I know what you're thinking babe.\"Stone has a strong presence and a likeable, engaging set of pipes, even if her full potential seems to be seething below the surface. Still, it comes as no surprise that the entire record sounds like one very long song that's both overcooked and overzealous. The only slight variations come in the form of cool-as-cucumber ballads like \"Bruised But Not Broken\" and \"What Were We Thinking?,\" leaving the mildly hooky \"Headturner\" as, well, the only head turner left on the disc.As Christina Aguilera keeps on proving, a fine voice does not automatically equal a fine album. Whereas she goes way over the top in her performances, ripping fine ballads to shreds, Stone takes a different course: Holding back too often, and accumulating less than stellar compositions. Both are guilty of imitating their influences far too obviously; in a perfect world, Etta James would be receiving royalties.At age 19, Stone is still young, and will doubtless go through many a \"change\" in what is sure to be a long, fruitful career in commercial terms. She may well make fine records one day too, but \"Introducing Joss Stone\" is merely mediocre; a half-hearted testament to her talent with only the guise of brilliance at its disposal", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Stone Embraces 'Change' Yet Again (2.5 stars)", "unixReviewTime": 1176163200, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2007"}

For the Pumpkins things started falling apart when Jimmy Chamberlain was fired, D'Arcy left the band as well as James Iha. And everything... and I mean, EVERYTHING had to do with Corgan's huge ego and his closed minded attitude toward the rest of the band members. Musically he's a genius (Siamese dream (1993), Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness (1995), Adore (1998) and even the masterpiece of \"Machina/the machines of God\" (2000)) unfortunely, as what is expected to happen to every genius that gets lost on his own world without listening nor taking anything from anyone in the \"outside\" world, he was left alone and without ANY doubt, the other band members were his best options when it came to translate ideas into music (Chamberlin's drums on songs like \"ode to anyone\" (Mellon collie-1995), Iha's guitars on songs like \"Zero\", \"Bullet with...\" (Mellon collie-1995) and even \"disarm\" (siamese dream-1993) and Arcy's bass in her wonderful performance on the song \"Raindrops and sunshowers\" (Machina-2000). I hardly doubt that Corgan will ever captured the aura on his music the way he did with the original band members and I also hardly doubt that he will ever see the guilt he has always had on the Pumpkins's end.Funnily enough (and as a HUGE R.E.M. fan that I am) once Corgan said in an interview back in the 90's that he didn't like R.E.M. and he had issues with Michael Stipe (lead singer). Well, what happened here is that his ego had this problem of seeing a succesful band for so many years together but what he never understood is that this is no magic at all. If you're decided to keep a band together you have to go beyond the music, being open to new ideas, respect your band members ideologies and listen to them. So, what is the conclusion here: R.E.M.= 14 albums recorded and keep on counting, 30 years together already and yet, one of the most humble bands I've ever seen. The Smashing pumpkins= 5 albums recorded (with original band members), 10 years together split and then came back with an uncertain future now and yet, Corgan wants to keep his dream alive as well as his ego.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "This is Corgan's fault", "unixReviewTime": 1262304000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2010"}

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"", "helpful": [12, 23], "reviewText": "Back in the early 2000s, garage rock was going to be the \"next big thing\" after the forthcoming decline of pop-punk and Britney Spears. You had The Hives, The Vines, and perhaps most importantly, The White Stripes. Perhaps it was their mystique (Are the brother and sister? Husband and wife?), or maybe it was Jack White's amazing ability to take a single guitar and make it sound like anything he wanted it to, but The White Stripes have hung around long after all those other bands faded into \"Oh, who sang that one song?\" territory. For better or for worse, The Stripes have stuck to their guns, staying true to the music that got them rich and famous. But should we still care?If the title track is any indication of what's coming on the rest of the album, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Unfortunately, it isn't. \"Icky Thump\" is a raw channeling of classic rock 'n' roll with some added Stripes flair. Jack White is at his absolute best here, utilizing his singing, half talking method of delivery that has helped in their rise to fame. At the same time, some of his lyrics are just absurd. Take, for example, \"White Americans want nothing better to do. Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too!\" Umm, sorry Jacky boy. That's not exactly how it works. Stick to the guitar and save yourself the embarrassment that is sure to accompany your haphazard political statements.\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told)\" has a more traditional southern rock sound to it. In my initial listen to the song, I wasn't too impressed. However, I was surprised to find its melody stuck in my head later in the day. Still, we've heard this all before from the band, so it is more of a guilty pleasure than anything else. \"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\" is a really great song, despite the fact that it's one of the calmest songs on the album. The guitar riff that runs throughout the song is absolutely infectious, and the screechy, chaotic solos are just as impressive. When Jack sings, \"One thing's for sure; in that graveyard I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes\" I chuckled a little bit and though that it could very well be the coolest ending to a song that I've heard in a while.Perhaps the most impressive song on the album is \"Conquest,\" a cover of Patti Page's 1950's battle of the sexes classic. The song has a very south of the border feel to it, complete with mariachi trumpets and Jack White's belting of \"Coooooonqueeest!\" It is a very stylish, and cool song. \"Bone Broke\" has classic White Stripes written all over it. Jack's vocals are completely thrashed with distortion, and there are hints of \"Fell In Love With a Girl\" all over it, despite it's toned-down nature.There are very few notable tracks throughout the album's second half, which is perhaps the biggest flaw of \"Icky Thump.\" Most of the songs end up bleeding into one another, sounding unbearably similar. In fact, the only thing really worth listening to are the things Jack does with the guitar. \"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\" and \"A Martyr for My Love for You\" both feature impressive guitar parts, the latter of which is actually a fairly decent song. \"Effect and Cause\" closes the album out nicely. A simple acoustic guitar song, Jack's vocals are impressive, and it's nice to hear the band trade layers of distortion for a relatively calm feel.\"Icky Thump\" is truly hit and miss. While there are some impressive tracks on the album, the band really brings nothing new to the table. Of course, when you're a two-person band and one of your members really can't play their instrument, it's tough to evolve. The White Stripes may have stuck around long after all those other \"The-bands\" fell off the face of the planet, but their music is just as stale. That may be a harsh assessment, but six albums into their career, The White Stripes have not progressed at all. Though it's nice to hear a little rock 'n' roll every now and then, these guys aren't saving the genre. They're choking it to death.Recommended for long-time fans of The White Stripes, and to anyone who likes classic rock but find themselves asking \"Who are the White Stripes?\" You'll find them refreshing.Key Tracks:1. \"Icky Thump\"2. \"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues\"3. \"Conquest\"4. \"A Martyr for My Love For You\"5. \"Effect and Cause\"5 out of 10 Stars", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just Go Ahead and Vote \"No\"", "unixReviewTime": 1182729600, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2007"}

But I won't because I'm lazy. But for the rap purists they probably have already given up on 50 after openly courting the suburban females on The Massacre. But 50 was quick to learn just how fickle the teenage girl is (remember O-Town? no? um, never mind) when the soundtrack to Get Rich or Die Trying barely sold a million copies after his first two major label album sold thirteen million combined. And it did not help that Lily Allen was able to take the unlistenable Window Shopper and flip into something extremely catchy.50, knowing he could never court back the hip-hop purist, completes his sell out on Curtis by bringing in the likes of Justin Timberlake (Ayo Technology), the chick from the Pussycat Dolls (who adds her vocal scratches Fire), and what album these days wouldn't be complete without Akon. But it is laughable heard a dude that looks like Starvin Marvin sing about gang warfare on I Still Kill.And 50 is quick to readily admit he's has sold out and flaunt it on songs like I Get Money and Straight to the Bank. The two songs are head scratches apposed to head noders. I Get Money for some reason features 50 chanting the cheesy Hip Hop Hooray hook. But when Naughty by Nature does it is cheesy good, when 50 does it is cheesy bad. Then Straight to the Bank features an annoying \"ha, ha, ha, ha\" chorus, courtesy of the always annoying Tony Yayo, where you have to ask how could anyone think that was a good idea.Curtis actually starts of with an actual classic 50 sound with My Gun Go Off and gets his gangsta on over a treacherous beat. But that quickly ends as the rest of the album is a muddled mess which is possibly thanks to having seventeen different producers listed for seventeen different tracks. Mary J. Blige brings some class to All of Me but it is just way to late to help the train wreck of an album.And 50 shows traits of someone trying to grasp onto the spotlight by just recycling past hits. Follow My Lead might as well be the 22nd Question but switched out Nate Dogg with the dude from Growing Pains' kid (a complete downgrade). And I will let you all discuss amongst yourself what the worse metaphor for sex is: Candy Shop or Amusement Park.

Then Fully Loaded Clip tries to update How to Rob but without the underlining humor.Even though the battle has been hyped for a month, it is a foregone conclusion that Kanye West will be the chart champ next week. 50 Cent's real competition will be with Kenny Chesney for second.

I have loved both Dire Straits and Mark's solo career uniformly up to this point, but I have listened to \"Kill to Get Crimson\" several times over the last couple of weeks, and it has largely failed to grow on me with a few exceptions.There is no question that the musicianship here is first rate; there are few things that I enjoy more than listening to Mark with an acoustic guitar in an ensemble setting (although I love the Stratocaster, too, of course!) but my problem with this release is the startling uniformity of the songs. One of the things I always appreciated about Mark was his ability to master different musical genres and styles within a given album; here the songs are simultaneously excellent, yet predictable. With the exception of \"Punish the Monkey\" the songs on this CD are largely interchangeable stylistically, to the overall detriment of the work. It pains me to say it, but some of the album is just...well, boring. While any given song can stand by itself, as a collection I was underwhelmed.I liked the first half of the CD less than the last half, with \"The Fizzy and the Still\" being my least favorite in the collection. The second half of the CD is more interesting. I like the corporate intrigue that is so well illustrated in \"Punish the Monkey,\" which I consider to be the best overall song on the CD. The other standout is \"The Fish and the Bird,\" a song about two star-crossed lovers who could never be together even though it creates lifelong pain; it's a beautiful song about responsible romantic realities. \"Let It All Go\" is another winner that highlights Mark as an ensemble musician.While I am reluctant to give any Mark Knopfler CD three stars, I still recommend the album to fans, particularly to Mark completists, folk, and country audiences. I am glad that I bought the CD, and though it will never be my favorite of his works, I will surely revisit it on occasion, and will certainly see him on the tour that supports the CD release.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Punish The Monkey; The Fish And The Bird Have Been Through Enough", "unixReviewTime": 1192665600, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2007"}

Most songs are very catchy, friendly tunes that provide a fun and rewarding listening experience. I do think this band has a lot of room to improve though.The female vocals are in fact very beautiful. She has a light, sweet, dynamic and vibrant tone, sounding remarkably similar to Emiliana Torrini and Ingrid Michaelson. If you like those artists, you may very well like this band, of course keep in mind this is a much different style.My main gripe is that the guitar work and production value on some songs is not the greatest. In particular, \"Oscar Wilde\" has very muted and distant sounding guitars, which is surprising because this song was used to promote the album. I suppose they could use that technique if other instruments were more prominent and the guitars were used more for rhythm and filling out the sound, but there aren't any extra instruments on this track. I guess this guy simply isn't the guitar-playing guru I take for granted in so much of my music and it is much more focused on the vocals. The end of \"Under the Umbrella\" (after an awkward and incoherent 9 seconds of silence, I might add) has an attempt at a guitar solo/instrumental section, but it seems completely directionless and uninspired.The album also seems a bit lopsided. Listening to the second half, it starts to become somewhat stale. I think they simply ran out of songwriting ideas, and figured by putting all the boring songs at the end, by that time no one will notice and only remember the good ones at the beginning. I actually listened to the album backwards to make sure of this and it's not just the general sound getting boring after a while. There isn't enough variation on these later tracks to keep the listener's interest, and exploring some different instruments wouldn't hurt. The booklet lists some violin and piano, but it's like finding a needle in a haystack to actually hear them. \"The Tornado Song\" has some prominent piano, but if fails to add an extra spark to this otherwise tedious bore-fest. While listening to \"New Letters\" and \"Under the Umbrella\" I can't help but keep wondering when something exciting will happen, while trying to tolerate the lousy guitar work. The \"choir\" singing in these tracks doesn't help either. I have heard many songs that add in choir-type vocals and they work great, but this just adds extra cheesiness.Please understand that I'm not bashing some of these songs just because they are slower, or more ballad-like. I enjoy plenty of slower songs. I love Tori Amos, and her heartfelt ballads are some of the best out there. I also enjoy lots of post-rock, instrumental and ambient music that has little or no \"hard rock\" value to it. This band simply, in many cases, can't come up with a good musical focus to give the listener a unique feeling that music is supposed to give you and the songs just wander aimlessly for way too long.There are several songs I really enjoy though. \"Quiet on the Front\" is perhaps my favorite song here. The use of harmonica provides a warm, nostalgic summertime feeling; I just wish they would use it a bit more than 5 seconds at the beginning of every chorus. \"Pressure\" is another one of my favorites with a very memorable chorus and laid-back feeling. \"Oscar Wilde\" is also one of the better tracks, despite my gripes about it. \"Old Letters\" is a nice opening track with a catchy rhythm, prominent bass line and some sprinkles of violin and piano. \"In Passing\" is a very quirky, upbeat and fun track.So, For the most part, I'm more impressed by this album than I thought I would be, but these guys have a lot of improving to do. I hope they do improve, as I think they have some decent potential. If they make another album someday I will probably check it out.Other similar artists you may be interested in may include The Essex Green (highly recommended), Anathallo, Emiliana Torrini, and even Death Cab for Cutie.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Catchy, Friendly Indie Rock, some hits and misses.", "unixReviewTime": 1238544000, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2009"}

Before he put out Port Of Miami, he used to put out mixtapes and his flow was a lot better then. True he talked about the same stuff he talks about now but at least his flow was okay. Once Port Of Miami came out he switched his flow around to a slow, lumpy and repetitive rapstyle while conjuring up the most annoying and lazy gimmick of all time: using adlibs to finish every rhyme. He did that on every other track of Port Of Miami plus the production was kind of fishy to begin with. On here he doesnt do that adlibs to finish up rhyme scheme and the production is head and shoulders above the production of Port Of Miami. His flow sounds exactly like it did on Freeway's Lights Get Low off of Free At Last all over this album.

This Is The Life feat Trey Songz is surprisingly good and The Boss Feat T-Pain(which samples Beastie Boys' Paul Revere) is okay. That's about it.

Here I Am featuring Nelly and Avery Storm is joke. Reppin My City, This Me and We Shinin are as generic as generic gets and Money Makes Me Come featuring Ebony Love is hot garbage.

Even the emotional range of co-balladeer Natalie Maines(of Rubin producedDixie Chicks) can't save an album that rarely even hits mid-tempo.

He invented the Hip Hop ballad with \"I Need Love\" from his next album \"Bigger and Deffer\" and he helped bridging the gap between Hip Hop and crossover appeal on \"Walking with a Panther\" aswell as being the fore runner for Bling Bling with it's album cover.  And One year later finding the perfect weight between commercialism and attitude on the Marley Mark produced \"Mama Said Knock You Out\", another Hip Hop classic. However his greatest strengt was always the songs for the ladies. LL rarely had explicit lyrics on his album, only happened twice and he was also able to find good colaborations at any time, working with anyone from Diddy, to Timbaland and the Neptunes. A career that stretches over three decades is impressive, especially considering that none of the Rappers from the mid 80's are still popular. But lately LL's albums haven't been so good, they always had hit singles but overall they weren neither too memorable or grounbreaking. His last album \"Todd Smith\" left alot to be desired to say the least. On his new album \"Exit 17\", originally called \"Todd Smith 2 : Back To Cool\" he tries to rejuvenate himself further. Handpicking in demand producers like JR Rotem, Ryan Leslie and Tricky Stewart aswell as calling old collegues like Marley Mark and DJ Scratch. This is his third album that got explicit lyrics and part of the reason is that he's trying way hard to aply to current trends. But that's isn't entirely a mainstream album, LL gives us songs for the ladies \"American Girl\", \"Cry\" and the hit \"Baby\" with the Dream aswell as classic hard edge songs \"You Better Watch Me\", \"This Is My Ring Tone\" and one political manifestation \"Mr President\" just in time for the presidential race and one about the demise of Hip Hop, called \"Dear Hip Hop\". The naughty \"Feel My Heart Beat\" with 50 Cent is just embarrasing and is everything that LL never did in the past and on \"Old School New School\" he seem to be saying he's one of the best, which is true if the year was 1993 and a failed party song called \"Time For Party\" with Fat Joe, that sounds more like 50 Cent by the way. But apart from some weak moments, there are highlights too. The Tricky Stewart produced Hit \"Baby\" is great aswell as \"Cry\" with Lil Mo with a really nice hook. On the somewhat cheesy \"Like A Radio\" Ryan Leslie goes old skool with beats resembling the 80's and a title that makes references to his classic album. I actually enjoy \"Mr President\" with Wyclef Jean singing a great hook over a funky beat and LL talking about problems going on in USA. The aformentioned closer \"Dear Hip Hop\" is another highlight, simular to the song Nas did some years ago but this one is very soulish in production.Overall, This one got it's fair share of lacklusters, especially with songs where LL tries to rejuvenate himself by trying to sound mianstream, but on other songs he disses contemporary Hip Hop claiming that he's one of the pioneers and still the best (huh?). However, it also got some pretty good songs like the some songs for the ladies and some harder songs, aswell as \"Mr President\" and \"Dear Hip Hop\" that both are welcome surprises. Hence the album is better then people are saying. While it's sometimes unfocused, give credit to the man for sticking around and still making good music every now and then.

She has a vulnerability that leaks out of the flaws in her voice, and I find that really endearing.  So, this review is coming form someone who views `Just Like You' is be near brilliance.  I really wanted something great from her, and the first half of the album had be wet with excitement; but overall this album kind of falls flat.To be honest, the second half of the album meanders in abysmal.I'll take this album in clumps.First we have tracks 2-5.  `Make Me Over' gets things off pretty well.  I find the constant repetitive \"make me over\" to be a little obnoxious, but the jive vibe that inhabits this up-tempo dance track helps sway this in my corner.  It is really a lot of fun and it shows a `different side' to Keyshia, something that she claimed this album would expose; so I'm happy with that.  `Please Don't Stop' is a better song overall.  It has a nice beat that balances dance beats with a more mellow and almost ballad feel.  Keyshia's voice is soft and delicate here, and the breakdown at about the 3 minute mark is virtually flawless.  `Erotic' is one of my favorite songs she's ever done, if not my favorite.  It is so sensually provocative and enchanting.  The beat is intoxicating and her vocals just slide all over your skin.  `You Complete Me' recalls some of the ballads she's already released, but a little familiarity never hurt anyone.  It's a sweet and nicely crafted song; nothing ultimately special but one of the best on the album.Next, we have 6-9.`No Other' starts the spiral downward.  I like the song, but it starts to border on mediocre, and Keyshia's constant decision to feature lackluster female rappers disturbs me.  She is working in an industry where she could garner support from much better talent.  Instead she allows the likes of Amina Harris to drag down an otherwise likable song.  `Oh-Oh, Yeah-Yea' is just decent at best.  There is nothing here to really capture our attention.  Here is where tracks start running into one another.  Sadly, we are only at the halfway mark now.  `Playa Cardz Right' is alright, but I just find it ridiculous when new artists decide to duet with dead artists.  It fits I guess, but this is far from noteworthy.`Brand New' is the worst thing on this album.  Its boring take on forced sensuality is amateurish and completely forgettable (hopefully).Next comes tracks 10 and 11.  The album starts to pick up a bit here.  I loathe the opening to `Trust' (that whole stupid conversation on the phone is so forced and so cheesy) but the song itself actually really works.  Keyshia has a great voice, but Monica really can sing (I mean REALLY) and so it was cool to see them singing together.  It only made me hate what has become of Monica.  `Thought You Should Know' isn't perfect, but it has something unique about it that makes it kind of jump out.  I love the laid back take, but it's not too laid back; it still has a bite to it.  It is the perfect chill song.  It even has elements that remind me of the more techno pop approach to music that genius artists like Robyn and Santigold have been experimenting with.And then the album resorts back to mediocrity with the closing clump, tracks 12-14.  `This Is Us' may be a different kind of vibe for Keyshia but it is hardly original, and it is very forgettable.  `Where This Love Could End Up' sounds like average Keyshia filler.  `Beautiful Music' isn't quite beautiful enough, if you can excuse my pun.  It's just mediocre.  In fact, it's below mediocre.  It's kind of tacky.This album feels very much like it ran out of ideas halfway through (less than halfway through).  There are some nice moments scattered here and there, and there are some good ideas floating around, but overall it fails to come together in the right ways.  I will certainly pounce all over Keyshia's next album because I have faith that she can bounce back.  This album is for the die-hard fan.  If you decide to skip this one, I won't blame you, but make sure you at least get your hands on `Erotic'.

It's difficult for any music fan not to be intrigued by such a combination of seemingly disparate genres, not to mention the unique duo of a white American man and a black woman originally from West Africa. I like different. I like unique. So much so that I specifically seek out music that aims to \"come original\", as 311 so succinctly phrased it.Unfortunately, despite the lofty claims of genre-bending innovation, this is a commercial pop record through and through. The studio polish glistens off each successive note brighter than the last, giving each track that over-produced sheen which inevitably sacrifices art for style. Second track \"This I Know\" is ripe for inclusion on any radio playlist, with its laidback melody and smooth chorus, yet remains entirely forgettable immediately afterwards. Why? Because Sam & Ruby sound like any of a hundred other acts crowding music halls and adult contemporary stations.This is a pleasant record, to be certain, it's simply difficult to believe this effort is the most artistically creative collection of music Sam & Ruby could offer. I think a deeper exploration into the whole genre fusion thing could be an electric experience. There have been a plethora of acts which established themselves with unique fusions between two seemingly disparate genres, such as hard rock & rap or folk & reggae. There is no question Sam & Ruby are supremely gifted musicians, and \"The Here and Now\" is an unoffensive and often quite pretty listen, yet it suffers from a bad case of abject banality.

I immediately thought that a Rage Against The Machine or Limp Bizkit sound mixed with Weezy's raspy voice would be a perfect blend. After all its not like this rock/rap collab hasn't been successful in the past. But something went wrong. This album has been delayed for almost a year. It almost hit \"Detox\" status before it finally dropped.  And now \"Rebirth\" is here but does anyone really care anymore.This album is definitely an experimental album, similar to Kanye West's \"808's & Heartbreak\". Weezy used Auto-tune throughout the album the same way Kanye did.  However, he actually managed to make some good music and Lil' Wayne's \"Rebirth\" is just comical. Songs like \"Ground Zero & Da Da Da\" were laughable. \"Paradise\" is Weezy's poor attempt at a love song which has him singing (yes singing) the whole song in Auto-tune. And \"Knockout & The Price Is Wrong\" were unbelievably bad. I really wonder what he was thinking with those two. Another problem is that you don't know what rock direction he's going to go from one song to the next. One minute he sounds like 3 Doors Down (\"Runnin\") and the next it's the B'52's (\"Get A Life\"). This inconsistency is what brings the album down. But when Lil' Wayne finally raps in his usual flow, that's when you get to see the potential of this album. \"One Way Trip\" shows what this album could have been.

His humble personality was refreshing, and his growth on the show was impressive, even if he may not have been the best pure vocalist on the Idol stage.  But being honest with myself, I can't rate his post-Idol debut 5 stars just because I like the guy.  While I feel this album has some quality characteristics and a few shining moments, when taken as a whole it's good...just not great.On A.I., Kris did wonders with little more than his acoustic guitar and voice, so the absence of such songs on this album is disappointing.  On a positive note, the overall production on this record is understated...it's nice to hear a modern pop record that doesn't use all the fancy studio wizardry and over-the-top special effects.  And, somewhat surprising to me, the more straightforward pop/rock songs sound more convincing and true than do the tracks that are supposed to be soulful or bluesy.  The exception to that might be the album's first single, the catchy \"Live Like We're Dying\", in which a Gavin DeGraw-style verse is combined with a chorus that borders on Hip Hop.You'll hear a lot of sections similar to what's popular from other bands in these songs, so there's a general lack of originality and creativity.  \"Can't Stay Away\" is a Jason Mraz/Maroon 5-type song all the way.  \"Bring It Back\" is a piano ballad that could easily find a spot on a OneRepublic or The Fray album (likewise with \"I Need To Know\").  Then there are the songs that just don't seem to go anywhere too exciting with the melody, such as \"Before We Come Undone\" or \"Let It Rain\".  \"Alright With Me\" sounds like it's trying to be fun and boppy, but ends up sounding a bit cheesy and includes a weak horn arrangement that doesn't help its cause.  The rendition of \"Heartless\" lacks the emotional impact of his Idol performance and would have been best left off the album entirely.Despite the generally average songwriting, a few tunes stand out and may make this record worthy of purchase.  \"The Truth\" is a pop-rock stunner in which Kris expands his vocal range to soar into a powerful, passionately performed chorus.  Pat Monahan of Train had his hand in delivering what could become a hit single.  \"Red Guitar\", a song written by Kris before his Idol fame, is beautifully arranged and contains the direction I'd like to see future albums heading.  And \"Lifetime\", co-written by the amazingly talented Jon Foreman of Switchfoot, breaks the mold of mediocrity in the songwriting department.Given the short time span American Idol finalists have to record their first albums, Kris Allen's is definitely no worse than the majority, and in some respects much better.  Many of the songs are catchy enough you may have trouble getting them out of your head.  The fact he got in so many songwriting credits bodes well for an improved follow-up, when time won't be as much of an issue.  In the meantime, this easy-on-the-ears debut should keep most fans more than happy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Kris' Post-Idol Debut Respectable Despite Lack Of Originality", "unixReviewTime": 1258416000, "reviewTime": "11 17, 2009"}

Clocking in a bit under two hours, the mammoth record is split into two slightly more manageable sides, although the differences between either are negligible. It's an interesting concept, and one that speaks to BT's desire to release an album as opposed to a dance record. There is an ebb and flow that's obvious from opener \"Suddenly\" to the Psychedelic Furs cover \"The Ghost in You\" that closes everything out. At times it's a rewarding experience, where all the jagged pieces fall together into a thing of seamless beauty that is as amazing for its coherence as it is for its understated complexity: check the shimmering collapse of \"The Emergency\" into the glitchy \"Every Other Way\" or the way the filthy house rave of instrumental \"The Rose of Jericho\" gracefully downshifts into new-wave rocker \"Forget Me.\" For a man of BT's talents it should come as no surprise, but it's hard to make it through a full listen of These Hopeful Machines without coming off with the impression that the record is a bit bloated, particularly much of the first and fourth tracks off the second disc, which meander about melodies and dreamy soundscapes without much of a purpose or hook.It should come as little surprise then, that amidst the typically excellent mood pieces and foot-stomping parties BT throws down, the album really succeeds on the contributions of its vocalists, from Transeau himself to guest vocalists like Rob Dickinson, Kirsty Hawkshaw, and Christian Burns. At times they make the track, as on Burns' urgent vocals on \"Suddenly\" or the delicate performance Transeau puts on \"The Ghost in You,\" which overhauls the original into an entirely new atmospheric beast. On the other hand, Hawkshaw's angelic work on \"A Million Stars\" comes off as far too airy, making the rather boring track seem like a bad Enya trance mix. Dickinson's throaty effort on \"Always,\" meanwhile gives the track a bit of a Nickelback-in-Ibiza vibe that is certainly off-putting only aided by the cheesy lyrics, although he redeems himself on the soulful, breezy \"The Unbreakable\" later on.Still, BT's true talents continue to lie in his house work, and on hard-hitting club mixes like \"The Rose of Jericho\" or the gritty synths and transcendent melodies of the bipolar \"Every Other Way,\" Transeau continues to prove he can progressive, fresh house with the best of them. While it's entertaining to see such a talent spread his wings beyond his most successful works, the uneven nature of These Hopeful Machines speaks to a scattered genius, one who is suitably proficient in everything from soft rock `n roll to fist-pumping anthems to hypnotic mood pieces, but one who still struggles to fit them all into a clear, consistent aural portrait.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "BT - These Hopeful Machines 6/10", "unixReviewTime": 1265068800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2010"}

What he's probably second best known for is being the Rick Rubin of indie music production.Whether it be Gorillaz (2005's \"Demon Days\"), The Black Keys (2008's \"Attack & Release\"), or Beck (2008's \"Modern Guilt\"), if you're looking to have success or revitalization within the genre of indie music you'd better consider working with Danger Mouse at some point.Most recently, we've seen Danger Mouse pop up with yet another \"Super Duo\". This time he's paired with The Shins' lead singer James Mercer under the name Broken Bells.Random? Yes.A good idea? Sure.This album is Broken Bells' self-titled debut and Mercer's voice seems to fit fairly well with the musical ambiance that Danger Mouse provides as both producer and performer. But Mercer's vocal style isn't distinctive enough to make his pairing with Danger Mouse a likely one in terms of the popularity that is associated with Burton these days. I guess that's why it seems random. But random is definitely not always bad.If you're looking for catchy melodies as well as poppy and laid back beats then \"Broken Bells\" is probably a good album for you. It provides a unique sound, which is always a welcomed thing no matter who you are (maybe). Even though Mercer's vocals might not be terribly distinctive they do seem to work with Burton's soulful production style, which has become well known for its throwback/psychedelic feel.I guess a possible reason the pairing of these two gentleman seems random is because after having listened to the album several times through, in some ways it feels a bit like the next Gnarls Barkley record only with a different singer. The songs aren't anywhere near as up-tempo as a lot of Gnarls Barkley songs are but given the soul/funk/R&B; tinge I halfway expected to hear Cee-Lo Green's voice at first.Usually elements of an album being considered interchangeable with something else means it's not really anything special or anything that would stand out as a classic and, to be honest, at the end of the day \"special\" or \"classic\" probably aren't terms I'd use to describe this album. Yes it's good, but probably not enough to stand the test of time. However, it's enjoyable and interesting enough to where I'll stay tuned to see what, if anything, these guys come up with next.Broken Bells' lead off single is the album's opening track, \"The High Road\". It's a good track but it seems to have fallen prey to the perils of radio. Portland radio is apparently in love with the song to the point that I already consider it to be over-played. It's to the point that when I listen to the album I usually start from track two.Distinguishable tracks:-Radio peril aside, \"The High Road\" really is a good track and is a prime example of great use of synths. Everything about the track screams that Danger Mouse was involved if you're at all familiar with his work.-\"Vaporize\" with its brooding organ sound and seemingly-unfitting-but-not acoustic guitar.-\"The Ghost Inside\" has a good beat and also has some fun handclaps, which have come to be a mainstay on any album Danger Mouse is involved in.-\"Mongrel Heart\" is about as up-tempo as the album gets which, by the point it rolls around as the second to last track on the album, is a welcomed change of pace.I'm not the biggest fan of indie music by any means, I find a lot of it to be very hit and miss, but I enjoyed this experience because it takes elements of music from the indie scene and by bringing Danger Mouse into the picture couples it with elements that make the experience a bit more interesting.

That's the sole purpose of this album. But the eclectic creativity of System is long gone, and the song writing is below that of the worst elevator music. This is just aural filler for CPAs and yuppies to host baby showers and provide inoffensive background music for staid corporate events. Even the lyrics suck (?!) because they are so direct. Direct isn't interesting, it's boring and talentless. The best lyrics are veiled and open to interpretation, as Seal has done so well in the past.But Seal did this on purpose. System proved he can still write great melodies, and is (was?) willing to dare to grow and try new collaborators. That album was 'amazing', start to finish (well, except that duet with this wife). If 6 had been his debut album, it would have tanked and been his last.But since this album sold well, at least in some 'markets,' we might get more of this tripe.

I must say, however, that the album is much shorter than its track listing would have one believe.  There are not 15 songs; instead, you are presented with about nine complete tracks and a handful of interludes consisting of ambient noise and chants.  I found it especially odd and a bit frustrating that the first two tracks alone make up a double-introduction.  There have been comparisons to a Pink Floydian-composition -- an epic, sprawling album that ties together as a cohesive piece.  There are similarities -- the sonar beeps on several tracks (reminiscent of Echoes), the fuzzy interludes that bridge the gaps between tracks, and even a track by the name of \"Empty Spaces.\"  But all comparisons aside, A Thousand Suns deserves to be listened to and fully digested to attempt any type of judgement.The first complete track, \"Burning In The Skies,\" continues where Minutes To Midnight left off.  It is an electronic ballad and every time I hear it -- not unlike several other tracks here -- I can't help but picture Transformers dancing around in my head.  This is obviously where Linkin Park has settled into as far as a comfort zone goes, but then why am I not satisfied?  Not a bad track -- actually one of the better ones -- but it still feels a bit incomplete to me.Another interlude...yes, three of the first four tracks are interludes...ugh.  Nothing even happens in this one -- it's eighteen freakin' seconds long for crying out loud!  Really?!  Guns and battle cries now emit the vibe of a war/anti-war theme...\"When They Come For Me\" is actually pretty tight and it is a relief to hear Mike Shinoda rock the mic.  Remember when this happened in every song?  Yeah, I barely do either.  Good tune though with a sick Eastern feel to it.  \"Robot Boy\" begins with and carries on with a familiar tune playing in the background.  Is that piano channeling T.I.'s \"What You Know\" in the background?  Maybe it's just me, but I can't help but picture Mr. Hahn and T.I. doing body shots off pole strippers when I hear this.  I can't really even decide if I like this one or not because I am now too distracted by the thought of dancing strippers.  While it has an epic feel and continues with the aforementioned Eastern-vibe, it is a pretty chill track and won't incite any riots; curb your enthusiasm please.Another interlude and sonar beeping...Ok, in my opinion, here is where the album truly takes off -- three bare-knuckle tracks that will even turn heads from the non-believers and those who had given up hope for LP.  \"Waiting For The End\" -- what to say about this one...I love it.  Yes, it becomes quite sugar-coated after a promising start, but I can't help but sing along with it every time it plays.  The verses have a Gorillaz feel to them -- think Plastic Beach -- before taking off into one of Linkin Park's most satisfying chorus's in recent memory.  I don't think this could be prevented from reaching mainstream radio if the studio themselves refused to release it.  \"Blackout\" is even better.  While it may not be the best, or even my favorite track (then again, maybe it is), it flat out kicks @$$ and could have passed as a Fragile-era Trent Reznor production.  It is also notable that Chester does release his blood-curdling scream (yes kids, a tiny taste of Hybrid Theory!) between staccato-laced verses on \"Blackout.\"  \"Wretched And Kings\" is a grimy hip-hop track with a reggae tinge, reminiscent of a Public Enemy joint and actually closely resembles the sound the band captured during the Meteora-era...solid track.You guessed it (interlude).\"Iridescent.\"  Hmm...I don't particularly care for this one.  Shinoda and Chester singing a boring ballad that could've been a Minutes to Midnight outtake?  No thanks.Another interlude brings us into the lead single, \"The Catalyst.\"  You love it, you hate it, or you just don't know about it.  I fit into the latter category.  Even after hearing it twenty or so times, I just don't know if I like it.  I don't go out of my way to change the radio station when it's on, but I'll skip it on my iPod in a flash, so take that with a grain of salt.  Certainly not the best track here, so hopefully that still gives hope to those timid of the \"new\" sound.The album closes with \"The Messenger,\" another ballad that recalls Chester's time spent with his first band, Grey Daze (check out \"Soul Song\").  It is a fitting, yet solemn close to an album that strives to break new ground and while they may indeed reach this coveted ground, it is not yet broken.  Is the album better than Minutes To Midnight?  Yes.  Much better?  No.  At least on A Thousand Suns, they get away from the U2-esque sound and move in a slightly new direction.  It is a step in the RIGHT direction, but I hope they continue to develop an edgier-industrial (e.g., \"Blackout\") sound moving forward (someone has to at least try and succeed Reznor, right?), though I won't hold my breath on that.  To call this album or any other LP album for that matter genre-breaking is a bit of a reach, even if there aren't many bands that can replicate their ability to compose music from clouds of static.

Bands often try to branch out to a new kind of sound, like Linkin Park did with Minutes to Midnight.  I can accept that.  Every great band has a clunker album mixed in there somewhere.  But two experimental, far-out albums in a row, makes me think this band has already peaked, and run out of creative ideas.Chester's voice is shot.

Now they turn fully in the opposite direction, the band nearly vanishes in the electronic wash of A Thousand Suns; a 47 minute art piece with half of the fifteen tracks being actual songs and the rest being a collection of speeches from the likes of John Oppenheimer and Martin Luther King and connecting interludes.Approaching the record as a project you can admire the anti-establishment / anti-war theme and the scope of a record that plays as one long track with 15 parts, unfortunately the lyrics and themes often fail to mesh with the music. The first song and third track \"Burning in the Sky\" has a pop music synth sound and vocal melody clashing with the chorus \"I'm swimming in the smoke, of bridges I have burned, don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve.\" A strong statement in the first song to set the tone for the record, but then the next song comes. \"When the Come for Me\" has a snappy, jazz/swing beat that draws images of a big theater stage dance number with strained rhymes \"not a monkey, will not dance, even if the beat's funky.\" There's also the horrible missteps of trying to sing in a Jamaican accent, or as if they where black rapper from south central LA, it's nearly inexcusable and far below the band.The first single, \"The Catalyst\" said it all for the record, just when the song should leap out hard and grab the listener this poppy, upbeat, drum and bass house-music synthesizer kicks in as if a different record, completely, is being played at the same time over the song. It's this type of jarring, misstep, mishmash that keeps what could have been a brilliant epic record from being just that.A Thousand Suns doesn't fail because it's a radical style change for Linkin Park, it fails because they don't know how to use the styles they are incorporating in context of lyrics and themes. There's no identity here, either of the band (which it seems is just Mike, Joe and Chester engineering and mixing samples)or of the work.

{"reviewerID": "A2ULSA0IRUE09E", "asin": "B003WTE886", "reviewerName": "Marc Cabir Davis", "helpful": [3, 6], "reviewText": "The evolution of country music into an alternate genre where its songs get radio-play has often been ridiculed - after all, we've had such pop-candy stalwarts such as Shania Twain, Carrie Underwood, and even Faith Hill to cite as examples. But Taylor Swift is a definitive example of the broadening of country music - to include influences such as rock and bluegrass, so much so that the `country' aspect of it is thoroughly diluted. It is with this palette that Swift has created \"Speak Now\", a decidedly inferior followup to her breakthrough album \"Fearless\", only because it's a very obvious sellout (much in the vein of Shania Twains \"Up\", but at least on that CD Shania had the decency to release separate albums for the pop, world, and country audiences - a feat that's never been replicated since).While \"Fearless\" wore its heart on its sleeve in an off-handed manner, \"Speak Now\" is more pointed and unnecessarily vicious. What seemed like innocent schoolgirl rants on \"Fearless\" have evolved into worrisome, even deranged complaints by a woman who is now well in her twenties. Prime amongst these is \"Dear John\" about John Mayer. Granted, I have no real fondness for Mayer either as a musician or as a personality of any sort, but how anyone could deserve such an accusatory track dedicated to them is beyond me. Ironically, this is the best track on the entire album - from a musical perspective - and if you can ignore the `woe is me' lyrics, there is much to enjoy here (let us pretend not to notice the absolute lack of chord progression on this song, but then again, any musician will tell you that all of Swifts songs are written in the `key of flat', so no surprises there).The innate issue with an album of this sort is that you get into it expecting more of the same that you saw on her earlier work, but the sheen has worn off, and the results aren't exactly pretty. Lead single \"Mine\", which seemed to me a stellar first single especially due to its lyrics on the chorus, ironically stalled at No. 2 on the Country Charts and didn't give Taylor the No. 1 Billboard Country Songs ribbon that she'd wanted. It was widely expected that this song would do that, but it didn't. Second single \"Back to December\" is interesting only because Swift appears to be taking the blame on this (rather than constantly blaming everyone else, which, lets be honest, is her musical forte!), but the verse-chorus-verse here is rather listenable and you might find yourself singing along to this on the radio. However, for every listenable track here, there are tons of rather poorly constructed and ill-performed numbers that go literally nowhere. \"Mean\" for example is meant to address a particular media journalist but ends up as rather tacky and in sad taste. The same can be said of the faux-rock mood of \"The Story of Us\" which was a very weak melody to begin with. These problems were not apparent on \"Fearless\" where even random album tracks such as \"Youre not sorry\" could have been potential hit singles.The other issue is that \"Speak Now\" is front-loaded with all its potential hits and the `big songs', leading to the album falling to pieces in the second half. This is unfortunate because they were really onto something with the first half, at least in terms of scoring some radio airplay or replays on CD. I cant imagine anyone wanting to listen to \"Innocent\" (her very shoddy critique of the entire Kanye West episode) more than once, and \"Never Grow Up\" is just too easy. If you were expecting Swift to bring her A game and revolutionize country music, this is not the album you should be looking at. A quick glance at some other reviews will all give added points to packaging rather than quality. For example, one reviewer calls this the `best packaged CD of the last ten years' because of the cover art, inclusion of lyrics, and superior artwork. Point noted, but honestly, aren't we supposed to judge a music CD based on the actual music rather than the packaging? Or is that the state of current country music where an album cover makes the CD get an extra star? The last two songs on this album, especially \"Long Live\", are very much culled from demos and quickly recorded - and the impact they make is just as temporary and fleeting.The Deluxe Edition of this CD gets you six bonus tracks (3 new songs, two acoustic versions and a remix). \"Superman\", while interesting, should have made the lead edition of the album instead of the Deluxe as its obviously leaps and bounds over anything else on the Deluxe bonus CD. However, if you try comparing this to \"Fearless\", you will find that the deluxe edition is nowhere as great as that one (remember it contained tons of videos on the bonus DVD as well as some killer bonus tracks). Still, I suppose the effort is appreciated. \"Speak Now\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and broke records as it sold a million copies in the first week. Sales-wise, that is extremely impressive, but its not quite deserved, I think. There are ideas here, thoughts with some backbone, but their delivery is just not up to the mark, and while Taylor as a vocalist has definitely made strides (check out her crystal clear voice on \"Dear John\", which remains the album highlight), she needs to record better material. Also, this album would have been a whole lot better had they paid more attention to the entire second half of the record, which to me is virtually unlistenable. For those of you who think that comparisons to \"Fearless\" are uncalled for, well, it did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, so that's saying something, and does raise the benchmark pretty high. \"Speak Now\" just can't reach those heights though.Taylor Swift remains a reasonably talented singer (though not a country singer), and I must say that if I had to compare her two other contemporary country singers - Carrie Underwood & Miranda Lambert, she comes across as third on the list. Carrie's last album \"Play On\" is definitely notches better than \"Speak Now\" (hey, at least it was a `country' album), but Miranda Lambert currently rules the country roost for me with 2010's spectacular \"Revolution\". Comparing that exceptional album to Swifts new one is like comparing Chateaubriand steak to a Kit-Kat. Swift is out of her league on that one. But, shes still young and has a decent voice, so lets hope she finally records a proper country album some day (like perhaps \"Theres More Where That Came From\" by Lee Ann Womack. Now that's country!)Three Stars.

Kelly the undisputed King Of R&B.; One of them being the fact that the man's talent is unmatched in this ever changing music industry. Weather we are talking about his exceptional vocals, or his amazing swagger, or his ability to make every track he's a part of his own track. Another reason I call him the King of R&B;, is because he is a true musician in every sense of the word. He writes, produces, sings, and plays instruments on all of his own records. He rarely lets other people produce or write for him, with the exception of his last album Untitled, and his '98 record R. And not only does he produce/write the majority of his own music, he also does so for other artists ranging from the legendary Michael Jackson to the lesser know R&B; singer Joe. And another thing that has to be acknowledged about R.Kellys resume, is that he has been able to maintain relevance for almost 20 years, and not only maintain that relevance, but also dominate the R&B; genre for almost that entire time. He helped change R&B; into what it is today. Without R. Kelly, there wouldn't be any Usher's, or Chris Brown's, or Trey Songz's. R. Kelly paved the way for all of those artists, and not only that but he's also sold 40 million records and had a over 20 hit singles along the way. Needless to say, R. Kelly is easily the best modern day R&B; singer of our time. He's like the new Marvin Gaye, which R. Kelly considers Marvin to be one of his biggest influences, and some would argue that Kells is better. He's won Grammy's, Soul Train Awards, Lifetime Achievement Awards, graced covers of several magazines, produced his own mini movie... I mean honestly, what has the guy not done in his 20 year stint in this entertainment business?One of the things that I admire most about R. Kelly, is his diversity. He is such a unique artist that has so many different sides to his musical genius that it almost make it hard to tell what kind of artist he truly is. I mean obviously he is a bonafide R&B; singer, and there is no doubt about that. But the thing I love about R. Kelly, and this is probably one of the biggest reason's why he's been able to stay relevant all these years, is that he is always changing. And I don't know if \"Changing\" is really the right word im looking for, but he is always tweeking and adding different styles to his craft. Like I said there are so  many sides to R. Kelly's artistry, there's the partying \"Ignition\" and \"Fiesta\" R. Kelly, there's the club goer \"I'm A Flirt\" and \"Supaman High\" R. Kelly, there's the sentimental \"I Wish\" and \"I'm Your Angel\" R. Kelly, there's the inspirational \"I Believe I Can Fly\" and \"World's Greatest\" R. Kelly, there's the Thug \"Double Up\" and \"Playa's Only\" R. Kelly, and my personal favorite baby making time \"Echo\" and \"Bump and Grind\" R. Kelly... And of course there's the strait up, what I like to call the Loverman side of R. Kelly, which was mostly shown on his Chocolate Factory album, and now Love Letter as well... Like I said, the man is very versatile...Which is why he is probably my favorite artist of all time. It's because every one of his albums is different from the last or has a completely different theme than the last. R. was his radio ready breakthrough record, TP-2.com was his strait up baby maker, Chocolate Factory was a love album, Happy People/U Saved Me was stepper's music/gospel, Double Up was a hip hop record, and Untitled was a collage of contemporary R&B.; Now I'm not saying that those album's are strictly in those themes, obviously it can vary a little bit, but generally speaking his albums do tend to have a specific theme for the most part.Now if I had to compare Love Letter to any of his previous albums, it would be without a doubt in my mind compared to the love album Chocolate Factory. As a matter of fact, after the first listen to Love Letter, I was calling it the poor man's Chocolate Factory, because sonically and lyrically, both of the album's have the same warm, lovey, romantic vibe. With Love Letter he does have a strong throwback 60's/70's soul vibe, which was only sprinkled on Chocolate Factory, where as with Love Letter the throwback vibe does tend to dominate a little more, which is why the album is garnering strong reviews most likely. The problem with Love Letter, and what's keeping it from being a classic like Untitled, is that although it is nice and refreshing to hear that 70's  throwback style today among all the pop/r&b; thats dominating the charts today, Love Letter does drag a little bit and at times kind of starts to sound bland and a bit out dated. I'm not saying its a bad album or even sub par, but it's not one of his best albums. I understand what he was trying to accomplish with this album, but there's just not many songs at all on the album that have that aggressive, carnal tones that have made R the legend he is today. R. Kelly has always been known for his raunchy overly sexual baby makers, which is where he most successful and most dominant. And for me personally, the baby makers are my personal favorites from R. Kelly, because he does them the best...But there is little to none of that on Love Letter. Much like Chocolate Factory, on Love Letter the song's that do have any sort sexuality, which isn't much at all, but when there is that little bit of sexuality it's more in the form of romance than the typical raunchy style R. Kelly brings most of the time. Like on loud and roaring \"Taxi Cab\" or the mellow slow jam \"Lost In Your Love\", which are both standouts. But where R. Kelly really dominates on this album is the throwback soul slow jams, like on the smooth title track, and the old school \"When A Woman Love\", and on the groovy slow jam \"Number One Hit\", he compares his the love of his woman to that joy of a number one hit. \"Number One Hit\" sounds sooooo much like a track from Chocolate Factory that I almost wondered if it might have been from the Chocolate Factory sessions, the way he just smoothly glides across the mellow instrumental. It's for sure one of the standout cuts from the album, along with the catchy desperate I Want You Back anthem \"Radio Message\". And Mr. Kelly also does a pretty great cover of MJ's \"You Are Not Alone\", which isn't surprising since he wrote and produced the track for MJ. Overall, it's not a surprise that this album is getting the great reviews it is, and it will likely be looked at as a comeback record for R. Kelly even though he has never really left, as his last album Untitled was also great, but it was also a completely different style. The thing that will win a lot of people over with this record is it's soulfulness, and its throwback 70's soul vibe, which is rare these days from contemporary R&B; singers...It's not his best record, and I definitely do prefer Untitled over this one, but it is still a strong album...But if anyone can pull off this type of style change, it would be the extremely versatile Mr R. Kelly!Grade:C+", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "R. Kelly - Love Letter (3.5 stars)", "unixReviewTime": 1292457600, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2010"}

His songs \"Bad Liver & A Broken Heart,\" and \"Faulkner Street\" were so exceptionally good I had to chalk the rest of the album of as first-timer misjudgments.  To make a long story short, this sent me to the pile of new discs that floated into the house searching for his new release KMAG YOYO, thinking, and perhaps hoping that there had to be great material here, as it's been three years; and I'm sure he's gotten honest feedback in all that time.  Though with an audible sigh I must tell you that there's not much here either, other than \"Hard Out Here\" and \"Grand Parade.\"Which got me to thinking, perhaps there are a group of people out there who love the other tracks, and are scratching their heads wondering what in the world would possess Hayes to put the two tracks I love on the albums.  That concept made me smile, thinking that I was just looking for more of the same ... but I don't think that's true, I just don't feel that the rest of the album's that good, even if it is on the Lost Highway label.  Yes, Hayes Carll is easy goin', and yes, he's from Texas, where he's filled his album with heartfelt ballads to lovable misplaced losers, but the songs just don't resinate with me, they lack a soul.  True, they are clever enough, but one can't live by cleverness alone ... with a song like \"She Left Me For Jesus\" or bringing Afghanistan into the mix, for not only the title of the album with means Kiss my ass guys, you're on your own, but also for a song about a soldier who rockets to the moon on an acid fueled trip after stumbling across an IED.So, I'll keep these two lonely tracks in the spirit in which they were given, and smile with the satisfaction that I now have four perfect numbers infused with rockin' alternative country, songs able to stand on their one, and perk up my ears every time.Review by Jenell Kesler", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Hayes Carll - KMAG YOYO (& Other American Stories)", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}

While this recording certainly reflects a deviation in style from Mr. Beam's past work, it isn't as downright terrible (at least to my ears) as some of the Iron & Wine fans make it out to be.  The Iron & Wine project has been an evolving thing, gradually transforming from meditative solo acoustic guitar pieces with very personal lyrics (Creek Drank the Cradle, still my favorite of Mr. Beam's recordings and probably always will be) through to the more sonically diverse and somewhat experimental Shepherd's Dog. Here he has gone in yet another different direction, incorporating a more heavily electronica-tinged sound and some gospel influences into the mix. More than anything, this recording shows an artist willing to grow and take on new ideas.  Some of these songs are downright catchy, and in some ways it's the most purely fun album Sam Beam has released.  That said it doesn't have the depth of his earlier work and sometimes the electric sounds can grow a bit tiresome and seem like distracting  \"bells & whistles\" rather than anything necessarily intrinsic to shaping the songs themselves. When it all hangs together it works quite nicely however and I find myself coming back to the better tracks now & again.  Not the album I'd recommend as an introduction to Iron & Wine, and not something I'd expect to convert many new fans, but still an enjoyable and sophisticated musical experience that doesn't seem so out of place in Mr. Beam's constantly expanding repetoire.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3.5 Stars: A nice experiment", "unixReviewTime": 1313020800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2011"}

In the case of First Impressions of Earth, neither group were particularly pleased, as evidenced by the band's fervent attempt to recapture the magic of their earlier releases on their latest LP, Angles.To cut down to the core, this record is all surface, no substance. There are some catchy tunes here and there, but the record is too damn polished to be the Strokes and the songs are altogether not memorable, at least in comparison to the highlights on their first two albums. At its core, Angles is a recycling of the styles and moods that the Strokes built their career on, but this time around the sound is anything but fresh. They've become more accomplished musicians, but frankly that might be serving to the detriment of the punk-inspired gnarl of Is This It. First single Under Cover of Darkness is one of few highlights, but even it recycles the shuffle beats and punchy guitar strums of previous gems.Strokes fans dying for a new record will likely be somewhat satiated, but critics are not likely to be impressed with an OK record from a band capable of much better.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "The Strokes - Angles", "unixReviewTime": 1300752000, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2011"}

Blue Spotted-Tail is wonderful, mostly because of the simplicity of the acoustic guitar and melody line. But the problem for me, despite the clear effort that's gone into this disc, is that it just doesn't hang together very well as an album. Fleet Foxes have assembled a veritable pastiche of sounds that remind one -- too obviously at times -- of Crosby, Stills and Nash, the Beach Boys, even Simon and Garfunkel. There's too much of a grand statement trying too grandly to be made. Also, Robin Pecknold's voice is fine when it is surrounded by others in harmony, but is a bit too keening on its own. Anyway, I guess this isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I appreciate what Fleet Foxes are trying to do.

There is nothing groundbreaking about it and it sounds like a rehash of Vespertine, Selmasongs and Medulla....and sadly not a rehash of the gems of those respective albums.  There are a few tracks on this album that wish they were \"Pagan Poetry\" but don't come anywhere as close to the genius of that song.  I just don't understand why Bjork stays in this strange folky electronic moody dark drab world.  It was groundbreaking with Vespertine but lets move forward or if she's going to copy her old work, why cant it be something from the first three albums....ugh!I'll split this up into three categories.

And the second album \"Contra\" (from 2010) was pretty darn good too. Now, after 3+ years away, finally comes the band's highly anticipated third album.\"Modern Vampires of the City\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with an immediately pensive, piano-led \"Obvious Bicycle\". The energy level goes up a notch or two with \"Unbelievers\". Track 4 \"Diane Young\" (1st single) is the best track on the album for me, reminding me of the band's earlier output. But after that it's mostly back to mid-tempo tunes (\"Don't Lie\", \"Everlasting Arms\", \"Ya Hey\"), or outright slow songs or ballads, Vampire Weekend-style of course (\"Hannah Hunt\", \"Hudson\", \"Young Lion\"). There are a couple more flashes of the band we used to know late into the album on \"Finger Back\" and \"Worship You\".I bought this album last week, sound unheard, and purposefully did not post my review right away, as I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Now a week on, I can tell you that my feelings for this album have not improved. I scroll thrugh the many 5 star reviews posted on here, and I'm thinking to myself \"did we listen to the same album\"? I would sum up the situation as follows: listen to the opening tracks of the three VW albums one after another: \"Mansard Roof\" from VW, \"Horchata\" from Contra, and \"Obvious Bicyle\" from this album, and you'll know all you need to grasp the differences: Vampire Weekend has matured &lt;gasp>, yes the dreaded maturity has done it again. If you like the fun, breezy, clever sounds from the first two albums, you will likely be disappointed with the new album, as the musical landscape on \"Modern Vampires of the City\" is MILES away from the previous albums. Buyer beware!*UPDATE* (Oct '13) I saw Vampire Weekend in concert this past weekend at the Corona Capital festival in Mexico City. They brought a tremendous 75 min. set, mixing new and old tunes, and I must say that the new songs resonate live much better than on the album. The massive crowd just ate it up.

Many people will reward them for that, citing the \"evolve or die\" argument.  But if you were a fan of Vampire Weekend's first two albums (as I am) and excited for this new release (as I was), there's the potential for massive disappointment here.My primary source of disappointment (and the reason I decided to become the first 3* reviewer) is the total absence of notable guitar work on the album.  As a guitar player, I'm obviously biased, but I feel like Vampire Weekend had a few hallmarks to their sound that make them identifiable as a band.  One of those is the \"faux harpsichord\" progressions, which still appear on this album.  They also have some beautiful piano parts layered underneath Ezra's vocals.  But the guitar riffs - a variety of vintage, almost \"surf\"-like undertones - are almost completely gone, and that was one of my favorite aspects of Vampire Weekend's music.  Take virtually any notable VW song (A-Punk, Oxford Comma, Holiday, Cousins, etc.), and there is heavy guitar work that makes up the identity of those songs.  (The beautiful piano work on \"Taxi Cab\" would be a notable exception to this rule).  That VW has chosen to virtually eliminate guitar from the formula and become more a piano/electronic band doesn't make them \"bad\", but takes away an important element of what made them great.As a secondary complaint, I would note that there's real lack of energy in this album.  It reminds me a lot of all the things wrong with U2's \"No Line on the Horizon\" - excellent musicianship, but ask yourself an important question: \"Had this been the FIRST album from this band, would anyone have noticed them through the crowd?\".  It's possible to make a \"darker\" album without compromising the energy and formula that made your band appealing in the first place.My view appears to be a minority opinion, but I thought the first two albums were 5* all the way.  I'm 31 and I didn't consider them to be \"immature\" records in any sense.  I will stick with the album to see if it \"grows\", but normally when you hope for an album to \"grow\" on you, you're basically waiting for it to become something it's not.There's an assumption out there that individual bands need to \"grow up\" with us and become more serious and contemplative with us, as we presumably are also doing with age.  I don't agree with that.  I think that notable bands and artists \"stand\" for something, and allow you to seek that out if that's a mood or sentiment you want to experience.  It's possible for a band to start as something and become something else.  U2 has been everything from a Christian band to an Electronic/Dance band.  But if you want \"something different\", nobody's putting a gun to your head and forcing you to play Vampire Weekend.  Summers in Cape Cod are nowhere to be found on \"Modern Vampires\", and I kind of miss it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "If you like Vampire Weekend, you may or may not like this", "unixReviewTime": 1368576000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2013"}

That's not a slam on Lindsey's solo work, and I'm not slamming this album either. There are no terrible tracks on the release, but I would not say any of them are 5 star cuts. As has been pointed out by another reviewer, \"Without You\" is a bit too similar in structure to Cat Steven's \"Peace Train\" and the similarity is impossible to ignore once you hear it.  The best tracks are \"Sad Angel\" and \"Miss Fantasy.\" \"It Takes Time\" is a good song, but sounds like so many other slow tempo Buckingham tracks that it does not stand out.

It's hard to describe, but something about that debut album lit a post-punk fuse in me. I'd just begun listening to Gang of Four and had dabbled in The Jam as well. These cats were just the right modern take on a untouchable music noise that I was just beginning to love. I imagined Ray Davies sounding like \"Michael\", \"Darts Of Pleasure\", \"This Fire\", and the excellent \"Come On Home\" had he been born 20 years later. Alex Kapranos had this mix of snarky ambiguity and genuine sad sackery in his vocals and lyrics on that first album that I thought for sure they'd be spanking other revivalists of the same ilk in years to come. So I wasn't completely correct in that assumption. But I wasn't completely incorrect. You Could Have It So Much Better had these Scottish Orange Juice disciples putting their dance shoes away so they could show some rock machismo. Then 2009s Tonight: Franz Ferdinand was a mix of rock n' roll noise, dance floor strut, and Moog freakouts. Most folks in-the-know would say both of the follow-ups were sorta failures(records sales say differently), at least artistically. I'm not in-the-know.  I'm just a schlub from the Midwest that likes his beer strong, his pizza drowned in cheese, and his dance rock boogie-inducing. Franz Ferdinand have been known to be a bit bitey, rather cheesy at times, and can make this middle-aged white guy want to strut his wares more often than not. Well, after nearly breaking up, Franz Ferdinand have returned 4 years later with Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, and while not breaking new ground have made the best with the fertile soil they've been working for nearly 10 years.\"Right Action\" opens up with a familiar funky groove and a Kapranos sneer that tells you we're back in sweaty pub territory. It's a less venomous version of \"Take Me Out\", sped up and some farfisa organ thrown in for good measure. \"Evil Eye\" has a great 80s dance beat to it, with a sound not unlike Madness doing a spy theme. Kapranos and company have taken the great production values of Tonight: Franz Ferdinand and the grittier songs of their debut to make something that sounds crisp and tight, but not overproduced. \"Love Illumination\" is the single and while it's got some cool fuzzy guitar and even a horn section the track doesn't really go anywhere. \"Right Action\" would've been a great single choice. But like I said, I'm just a schlub. \"Stand On The Horizon\" is a nice little ballad that doubles as a dance floor disco burner. \"Bullet\" churns and burns but sorta sits in one gear, but it's got a great chorus.We get a lot of the same throughout the rest of this album. There's moments that shine, and others that sorta sit and wait for your approval. It's sorta sad for me, as in my eyes the Franz Ferdinand that won me over with their angular riffs and snarky storytelling don't need anyone's approval. As long as they do what they do best they'll be just fine. Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action isn't going to floor you. I'll admit it, Franz Ferdinand are a guilty pleasure.

Overall, the album has a sort of hypnotic, druggy-angelfeel, but lacks any real reason for me to want to hear it again, and seems destined for the salepile.  Nice, but it just puts me to sleep.

{"reviewerID": "A3GX1VI6FCV0IG", "asin": "B00GZAHGI8", "reviewerName": "Lypo Suck", "helpful": [4, 7], "reviewText": "Whereas in the past Dum Dum Girls mined a sound that was clearly inspired by the Primitives' earlier work and shambling c86 groups like the Shop Assistants (with a bit of a 60s girl group vibe thrown in), with Too True they've gone for a slicker vibe that seems to parallel the sort of \"path to maturity\" some 80s indie/alternative bands took in the later half of that decade, going from jagged, low-fi indie sketches to a more polished, lush sound. As a result, Too True readily brings to mind albums like Automatic by Jesus and Mary Chain, the Primitives' second album Pure, Pop Said... by the Darling Buds, and whatever the Divinyls were doing around that time. The drum machine is an obvious late 80s reference that supplies a mechanical feel typical of that era, while thick, fuzzed-out bass and guitars ranging from jangly to scratchy to chorus-y are all quite reminiscent of albums like Automatic and Pure. Do you remember some of the songs that were in heavy rotation on your local alternative radio station in 1988-89? That's exactly what they're going for here.But how are the tunes? While I can't really say there's a bad song in the bunch, per se, only a few of them really stand out as being particularly memorable or unique. \"Evil Blooms\" is one of the more tastefully catchy standouts, with a pleasantly lush arrangement, while \"Too Good To Be True's\" main melody vaguely recalls the chorus of Echo and the Bunnymen's \"Killing Moon\", albeit sped up and in a different key. The cool, steadily rocking \"Rimbaud Eyes\" reminds me a bit of whatever Darling Buds or Divinyls songs were being played on alternative radio stations in 1988, as does \"In The Wake Of You\". Maybe they should've done covers of \"Let's Go Round There\" and \"Pleasure and Pain\" to drive the point home. It's a nice enough album, but I can't escape the feeling that they're spending a little too much time copping this very specific late 80s pose, and not enough time crafting truly memorable, distinctive, resonant melodies. As a result, the whole thing seems a bit style over substance. They've definitely got potential, but they're just not quite taking things as far as they could compositionally, which to be honest, is kind of what I've been saying about them all along.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice, but a bit style over substance", "unixReviewTime": 1392163200, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2014"}

There's no doubt that this has been a long time coming and the end result is somewhat satisfying but far less interesting than some of their previous work.The LP opens promisingly, with lead single \"I Hope This Whole Thing Didn't Frighten You\" kicking things off in high gear. It's a solid rock tune, though for some reason Craig Finn's voice sounds distorted on the chorus. It's distracting and pulls you out of the song, a common problem that occurs frequently on Teeth Dreams. His unique vocals are constantly tweaked and laden with unnecessary effects that don't compliment the songs in any meaningful way. \"Spinners\" is one of the album's best cuts, a pop/rock tune that wouldn't sound out of place on a Counting Crows record, courtesy of jangley guitars and Finn's trademark storytelling. It's a solid start to the album and a worthy addition to the band's catalogue. It's a shame the rest of the album rarely scales these same heights.The next few tracks are a mixed bag of distorted noise and wavering melodies. \"The Only Thing\" is decent, if somewhat forgettable. \"The Ambassador\" gives the record some much-needed breathing room and has traces of previous ballads like \"Lord, I'm Discouraged\", yet doesn't do much to really distinguish itself in spite of this promise. The soft piano is a nice touch and it's an element that would have been well-served by being included more frequently on the album. \"On with the Business\" also fails to really stand out, a mediocre rock tune that unfortunately feels too much like a throwaway tune. \"Big Cig\" steers things back on course. It has just the right amount of lyrical intrigue and upbeat energy to make it worthwhile. Add to that one of the album's only big guitar solos and it all comes together wonderfully. \"Wait Awhile\" is a serviceable rock number while also feeling like a weaker version of \"Spinners\". Unfortunately it's too derivative to really stand on its own. \"Runner's High\" follows a similar path, a loud rocker that never really builds to anything spectacular.The last two tracks are where the album really comes around. The acoustic \"Almost Everything\" is wonderful, a bold track that makes me wish the rest of the album could have been sprinkled with this kind of diversity. The nine-minute closer \"Oaks\" wraps things up nicely and it once again brings much-needed diversity and laid-back atmosphere to the album. It never feels its length and harkens back to the classic sound that so many of us love about this band.Teeth Dreams is neither great nor horrible; rather, it straddles the line and offers a few tremendous moments with a lot of passable ones. Finn's voice is too distorted with various echo effects to ever really connect and his storytelling, while still strong, feels more passive this time without strong music to really back it up. The gorgeous and energetic melodies of previous releases are largely absent, replaced by noisy yet clumsy arrangements. The departure of keyboardist Fran Nicolay has still left a massive hole in the band that has yet to really be filled. The Hold Steady were always a rock band that could think outside the box and transcend labels; here they seem to be comfortable in its boundaries. The group is capable of so much more and after four years we're left with a loud, raucous effort that comes off as more forced and less playful.This album is simply lacking the fun that made previous efforts so engrossing and memorable. Ultimately Teeth Dreams is all bark and very little bite.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Muddy and Mixed Experience", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}
