Maybe I was expecting Shepherd\\'s Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd\\'s Eclipse.  The songs didn\\'t leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I\\'ve embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There\\'s an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn\\'t it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it\\'s an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya\\'s vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how\\'s this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can\\'t decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it\\'s more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song\\'s midsection.A reminiscing night traveller\\'s thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I\\'m on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya\\'s voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I\\'ve ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it\\'s &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There\\'s more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I\\'ve mentioned this.

I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don\\'t sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let\\'s say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It\\'s a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best \\'Gothic\\' song to this day. It\\'s almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It\\'s one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It\\'s a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it\\'s cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn\\'t play if you have not had much sleep because it\\'s one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let\\'s say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M\\'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it\\'s not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

Except where noted otherwise, each song is sung in English.Enya is one of the best composers and performers I know to unwind with; another in this category is Ryan Miller, who composed the soundtracks for the video games MYST and RIVEN.\\\\\"The Memory of Trees\\\\\" (instrumental and voices, no lyrics) Waltz tempo, opening with electronic keyboard, joined by piano. Enya joins in vocally but without words partway through. The main theme is about six notes long, continually repeated with variations. One of my two favourites on this CD, ranked only after \\\\\"China Roses\\\\\".\\\\\"Anywhere Is\\\\\" Unusually staccato for Enya, mainly string accompaniment. No percussion, some piano. The lyrics are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus, when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the words a little. (\\\\\"You go there you\\'re gone forever / I go there I\\'ll lose my way / if we stay here we\\'re not together / Anywhere is\\\\\").\\\\\"Pax Deorum\\\\\" (sung in Latin) Noticeably deeper pitched-chorus and accompaniment than usual. The accompaniment includes some percussion, in this case base drum, although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard.\\\\\"Athair ar Neamh\\\\\" is sung in Gaelic, with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that Enya\\'s voice carries the main lyrics very clearly. During the chorus, a multiple-track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blurs the effect a little. Very clear and bell-like, on the whole.\\\\\"From Where I Am\\\\\" (instrumental only) Specifically piano. As usual with Enya, her piano solo here makes me think of water imagery.\\\\\"China Roses\\\\\" Waltz tempo again, opening with electronic keyboard, but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano. \\\\\"I know that if I have heaven / there is nothing to desire; Rain and river, a world of wonder / may be paradise to me.\\\\\" Most of the verses contain a reference to heaven, the night sky.\\\\\"Hope Has a Place\\\\\" I would tentatively call this waltz tempo again, but it\\'s very slow, and the beat isn\\'t quite regular. Enya\\'s singing comes through very clearly herein (except for the more complex choruses, as usual). The accompaniment consists of very simple chords on an electric keyboard so as not to drown out the singing. The refrain is \\\\\"Hope has a place in a lover\\'s heart.\\\\\"\\\\\"Tea House Moon\\\\\" (instrumental) Unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one. Doesn\\'t seem typical of Enya\\'s work.\\\\\"Once You Had Gold\\\\\", \\'once you had silver / Then came the rains / out of the blue. / Ever and always, / always and ever,\\\\\" with the refrain \\\\\"Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.\\\\\" Waltz tempo again, almost a lullaby in this instance, Enya\\'s singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus.\\\\\"La Sonadora\\\\\" - Sung in Spanish, very drowsily, waltz tempo again. The quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string, with organ joining in after a couple of verses.\\\\\"On My Way Home\\\\\" - Opens with organ accompaniment, as in the later part of the previous song, but then switches to a very staccato keyboard accompanying Enya\\'s singing. \\\\\"On my way home / I remember / only good days.\\\\\"\", \"overall\": 4.0, \"summary\": \"11 tracks\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1114473600, \"reviewTime\": \"04 26, 2005\"}\\n', '{\"reviewerID\": \"AYZCMVSSL4X4B\", \"asin\": \"5555991584\", \"reviewerName\": \"Thijs\", \"helpful\": [4, 5], \"reviewText\": \"The Memory Of Trees begins with the stunning titletrack, a great mix of voices and instrumental sounds, this is one of Enya\\'s best songs.

Yes, I think that these albums are equal in greatness and significance. However, I have come to enjoy Pet Sounds a little more. Even Paul McCartney has identified Pet Sounds as one of his all-time favorites and rightfully so.Throughout their careers, the Beach Boys released other works that have come to be noteworthy pop standards but never at the level of this one. In a way Pet Sounds was and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what-ifs and what-might-have-beens. To me there are now two great mysteries in rock-and-roll history that will forever remain: 1.

The bass lines in particular are worth noting, as they  so often help create sonic tension. All of the musicians used are top  notch. 2. The warmth and depth of the recordings. Every groove sounds like  a canyon, though without the excess mushy echo of Phil Spector. 3. The  dazzling vocal harmonies. The Beach Boys were known for them, and here they  reach new heights. 4. The sincere emotional depth of Brian Wilson. You can  practically hear him pouring his heart and soul into the project, taking  catchy pop tunes and turning them into quasi spiritual moments. 5. The  belief inherent in such an unusual project that pop music can be something  more than just dance or party music. Brian Wilson conceived this as  something of a &quot;teenage symphony to God.&quot;  I am glad this  recording is available in both its original mono and its stereo form.  Regardless of which you prefer, this sounds good (with headphones, it  sparkles as the rich tones wash over you), and it is important to hear the  mono version for insight into how the record originally appeared.

And, there is that here, in the joyous strains of  &quot;Wouldn\\'t It Be Nice&quot; (with probably one of the most famous  opening drumbeats in pop history), and &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;,  but there\\'s also a lot of longing, loneliness, questioning and  disappointment between the grooves, all complimented wonderfully by the  atmospheric and ethereal arrangements played mainly by Brian and session  musicians.  This is probably one of the first and finest examples of a true  studio creation--a concept album where all of the tracks seem of a piece.  Even the lyrics have grown past the cars, girls and surfing; intentional or  not, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has deceptively simple verses that double  back on their meaning (&quot;I may not always love you/but long as there  are stars above you/you never need to doubt it/I\\'ll make you so sure about  it...&quot;).

The white seagulls circle overhead (watch out!), and I have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this Seer\\'s cape. They said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperatures. They lied. And, aside from all that, just when I get the sand castle to a stately form, some freckle-faced, red-headed bratty boy comes around and knocks it down. I threatened to report him to The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Seers, however, an ice cream cone made him go away. Dealing with Guido has made me very adept in any situation. Now if only the tides would stop being a threat. Ah well..........Anyway, I am in the perfect setting to examine the rewards of \\\\\"Pet Sounds\\\\\" by the Beach Boys. Much has been written about this seminal album. And why not? It consistently ranks in the top 10 pop-rock albums of all time. And rightly so if you ask me.Of course, it wasn\\'t greeted ethusiastically when it came out. At least not as much as their prior hits. Brian Wilson took the hit most of all. Probably unjustly. But time has proven that it was the right move and the right time. To most, perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time. But I would have to disagree with that. Brian was ahead of everything on the scene at that time. He saw that the music was changing. Plus, artistically, you can not stay in the same place. Artistry needs real growth. Meanwhile, the other Beach Boys needed more hits- and this is why the chasm happened.But, lets get into this a little more. The Beach Boys were (and still are) the ultimate summer group. Songs about California Girls, fast cars, high school life, requited love, and teen angst, angst, angst.  These songs were incredibly successful. But Brian knew that, as he got older, his audience were also doing the same thing. He wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication. Looking back to 1966, this album is a monumental achievement- and remains so until this day. Sure, some may downplay the importance of this recording, however, that cannot eliminate the fact that it was a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever. It is essential, and one of the very best.But, getting to the main point. Brian Wilson was moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotions on record. This was a mega step- and quite a risk at the same time. Most of the music is lush, well thought out, and instruments used precisely to get the right nuances that bounced around in his mind. Certainly the songs are confessional, i.e; \\\\\"You Still Believe in Me\\\\\", emotional, i.e, \\\\\"That\\'s Not Me\\\\\", \\\\\"I\\'m Waiting for the Day\\\\\", and quiet, heartfelt romance, i.e; \\\\\"Don\\'t Talk (Put Your Head on my Shoulder)\\\\\".  One must, of course, listen to all the colours and passages in this music. All these songs have a way of revealing certain moods that marry the music perfectly. Beautiful lilting breaks, shifting meter, an array of musical instruments heretofore never thought of in the pop-rock genre. Excellent.And songs? We are treated to different, but essential, gratuitous hits with \\\\\"Wouldn\\'t It Be Nice\\\\\" and \\\\\"Sloop John B\\\\\". But more than this, Brian gives us 2 more considerable high standard gems. Yes. We get to \\\\\"God Only Knows\\\\\" which I nominate as the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music. Grandiose, glorious- I am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song. Sweet, yearning, beautiful beyond compare. Angelic vocals as well. If anyone doubts Brian Wilson\\'s genius, have them look to this song. Absolutely the highest gem. Then we get to the wispful \\\\\"Caroline No\\\\\". Brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship. He looks back to a time when his love was new and exciting and wonders why she changed. \\\\\"Where is the girl I used to know\\\\\"? He hurts badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship, knowing full well that it has changed forever. Listen to the end. A train in the distance, approaching at a rapid pace, getting louder, and then quickly passing by. A dog barks in the distance-urging its return. But it gone and then silence. What an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending. Superb.In a way, the outtake of \\\\\"I know There\\'s an Answer\\\\\" entitled \\\\\"Hold On to Your Ego\\\\\" to me, conveys the frustration Brian was going through in order to have the other members of the group in compliance with his new direction. But he knows he\\'s alone and he knows that he\\'s \\\\\"going to lose the fight\\\\\". Well, he may have lost it to them- however- he won the classic album. And we are all so much better that he did.Now, I must go and make sure that kid isn\\'t planning some new attack on my new home. I don\\'t want to lose the fight anymore than Brian does.In conclusion- a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection.Goats say \\\\\"feed me\\\\\", Seers say \\\\\"read me\\\\\". -- yours, Metamorpho\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Wouldn\\'t It Be Nice to Live Together, in the Kind of World Where We Belong?\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1184371200, \"reviewTime\": \"07 14, 2007\"}\\n', '{\"reviewerID\": \"A22DKBJRTMY7UK\", \"asin\": \"B00000016W\", \"reviewerName\": \"Michael A.

With these two 1965 lps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created. In December 1965 after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles \\\\\"Rubbersoul\\\\\", a statement album from the fab four, implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit, not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler. Brian was amazed at the simularities between the just released \\\\\"Rubbersoul\\\\\" and The Beach Boys earlier 1965 releases \\\\\"Today\\\\\" and \\\\\"Summer Days and Summer nights\\\\\". Brian would say \\\\\"I want to make a record just like that, but I want to make it better!\\\\\"Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles. And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history. In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared  to be told to \\\\\"go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds\\\\\". Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound. An incredible early psychedelic recording released May 16,1966 which influenced the Beatles 1967 Sgt.Pepper so much that George Martin has stated \\\\\"if it were\\'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt. Pepper would not have been created\\\\\". Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music. Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and anger.1966 was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time on Aug.5th 1966 the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece \\\\\"Revolver\\\\\". Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt.Pepper, of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation. The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october 1966 as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece \\\\\"Good Vibrations\\\\\" just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt. Pepper recording sessions.The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release. Even with the success of Revolver, the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy, and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed  rivals. The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgance, but Pet Sounds  really made the psychedelic  era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper. As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds, if it were\\'nt for Brians over indulgance in bad habits, will never know. Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique, Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds.Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released, but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien, as their minds were just blown away by it. I listen to both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds  and there is some really eerie simularities, besides the instrumentation between the two, on Pet Sounds after \\\\\"Caroline No\\\\\" the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes. On Sgt. Pepper you hear barn animals, possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane. Pink Floyd would use animals sounds in their 1970s work, 1970 \\\\\"Atom Heart Mother\\\\\" including a cow on the cover of the lp. Pink Floyd in 1976 released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show, I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that?Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for 6-8 months to make Sgt. Pepper. To make Sgt. Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Because of this Sgt. Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past, present and future. The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin.John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin vs. Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was on his own and had no real help, even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative, musical skills. The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road. I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson (Tony Asher) as a song writer and music creator. In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era, a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form. I like having both versions of Pet Sounds, Mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono.I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings, but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966. The 5.1 stereo sound is  mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system, you will not beleive Pet Sounds could sound this incredible. Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history. Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era. I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings ever created.This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered. The miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording. Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording.Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s, early 1970s, which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time.

Dazzling harmonies highlight the ballad \\\\\"You Still Believe in Me\\\\\" before the band swings into the highly personal, uptempo \\\\\"That\\'s Not Me.\\\\\"  Brian Wilson\\'s romantic \\\\\"Don\\'t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)\\\\\" is amazingly intimate, and then the mood shifts once more for a romp with \\\\\"I\\'m Waiting for the Day.\\\\\"  The jazzy instrumental \\\\\"Let\\'s Go Away for Awhile\\\\\" leads into one of the Beach Boys\\' most beloved story songs, \\\\\"Sloop John B,\\\\\" a folky, jaunty-sounding song that tells a very sad and disturbing tale. If PET SOUNDS is arguably the best album of the past 50 years, then \\\\\"God Only Knows\\\\\" is arguably the best song.  Take a stunningly beautiful melody, overlay it with instantly relatable and honest lyrics and a bracingly innocent vocal performance filled with longing and the sweet pain that only love can bring...and then wrap it in some of the lushest arranging and instrumentation ever heard on record...and you have a song that is an enduring and beloved classic.  Confession and hope imbue the next track, \\\\\"I Know There\\'s An Answer\\\\\" with a positive, refreshing sense of survival...made all the more poignant now knowing Brian\\'s state of mind when he was working on PET SOUNDS and the subsequent SMILE.  The tempo picks up again for \\\\\"Here Today,\\\\\" before cooling back down again for the heartbreaking \\\\\"I Just Wasn\\'t Made for These Times,\\\\\" a song destined to be Brian Wilson\\'s epitaph.  The title track is a cool, exotic instrumental that sounds like a surf tune arranged and orchestrated by Nelson Riddle.  With \\\\\"Caroline, No\\\\\" Brian Wilson takes a very simple line, \\\\\"Where did your long hair go?\\\\\" and spins it into a metaphor for lost innocence in life, in relationships, and indeed, for an entire generation.  One finds themselves overusing the word \\\\\"poignant\\\\\" to describe songs on PET SOUNDS but is certainly is an apt word...especially for \\\\\"Caroline, No\\\\\".  The bonus track, \\\\\"Hang On to Your Ego,\\\\\" is an alternate take for \\\\\"I Know There\\'s An Answer,\\\\\" and it is enlightening when juxtaposed with the final version.  Because of it\\'s cohesiveness musically and thematically, PET SOUNDS is one of those few CDs that virtually demands to be listened to, uninterrupted, from start to finish every time.  Give it a spin and let it grow on you...I used to love PET SOUNDS, but now, I consider it an absolutely indespensible part of my CD collection.

It is definitely the high-water mark for the Beach Boys. This is not anything like their early Jan & Dean-inspired surf music. It invented a whole new vocabulary of sounds and forms for pop music.More than ever before, the Beach Boys\\' leader, Brian Wilson, decided he was going to go in a new direction and write a cohesive album, over the protests of many others in the band. He was definitely right. The Beach Boys never reached this level of creativity again, but \\\\\"Pet Sounds\\\\\" was enough to put them in the pantheon of the greats, even if this quality of artistic achievement was not sustained over time.Wilson says he was inspired to make the record by the Beatles\\' \\\\\"Rubber Soul\\\\\" album. The Beatles in turn credited \\\\\"Pet Sounds\\\\\" as the inspiration for \\\\\"Sgt Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\\\\\". Paul McCartney still says he is crazy about the album, John Lennon even acknowledged it, and George Martin said Sgt Pepper\\'s would never have been made without \\\\\"Pet Sounds\\\\\". Eric Clapton says it\\'s one of the greatest pop albums of all time and Elton John talks about how it changed the way he and everyone else approached recording. I say this just to underline that it\\'s hard to underestimate the impact this record had on the development of popular music as we know it.There are plenty of \\\\\"greatest hits\\\\\" here. The album starts out with the classic \\\\\"Wouldn\\'t It Be Nice\\\\\", one of the most optimistic and upbeat romantic pop hits ever -- and which also includes incredible layers of sound that deserve a good listening to with headphones. \\\\\"God Only Knows\\\\\" was the B-side to that single, but became a major hit on its own. \\\\\"Caroline, No\\\\\", \\\\\"Sloop John B\\\\\", \\\\\"Let\\'s Go Away for a While\\\\\" and \\\\\"Here Today\\\\\" were also singles and are probably known at some level by most listeners.But don\\'t just get it for the hits. A lot of the other songs are slower and more complex, but are really marvels of both pop composition and sound engineering, especially when you think about the 1960s technology they were working with. There are layers upon layers of crystal-clear sounds to enjoy and get lost in.This album is every bit as impressive a recording as something like Pink Floyd\\'s \\\\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\\\\" -- it just seems \\\\\"lighter\\\\\" because, well, it is. It\\'s an optimistic, feel-good record even when its gets sad and melancholy, which it does pretty often. I still can\\'t figure out quite how Brian Wilson pulled that off.If you don\\'t know Pet Sounds, this deal can\\'t be beat, especially at the $1.99 \\\\\"Deal of the Day\\\\\" price on May 1, 2009.

Acoustic Guitars and Banjos and Fiddles were overwhelmed and swallowed up by Electric Guitars and Peddle Steel Guitars.  A successful Bluegrass album sold maybe 30,000.  The &quot;dirty little secret&quot; in Nashville was that the Bluegrass musicians were the ones who could really PLAY, so talented bluegrassers who wanted to make a decent living became Nashville studio musicians.  Bluegrass fans, who are often as fanatical about the music as a religious zealot is about their religion, considered such musicians to have &quot;sold out&quot;, and so it was that artists like Ricky Skaggs, Bill Keith, Marty Stuart and Vince Gill were considered.  Once big fish in the small Bluegrass pond, they were thought by Bluegrass Purists to have compromised their artistic integrity to become Country successes. (Was it ironic that Ricky Skagg\\'s first Country Hit was a &quot;countrified&quot; version of Lester Flatt\\'s &quot;Don\\'t Get Above Your Raisin\\'?&quot;)The purpose of this review isn\\'t to give even a thumbnail history lesson of the evolution of Bluegrass and a comparison to more popular and &quot;mainstream&quot; forms of music, but it is important in having a complete appreciation of this album to recognize the historical rarity of a &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;breakout&quot; Bluegrass artist or band or recording.  In the past half-century before Alison Krauss the number of Bluegrass recordings which received any degree of popular airplay could be easily counted on one hand:Flatt and Scruggs &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; - the music used as the musical theme to &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.Flatt and Scruggs &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot; - the theme to &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;&quot;Dueling Banjos&quot; - from the soundtrack to &quot;Deliverance&quot;&quot;Rocky Top&quot; - by the Osborne Brothers&quot;Fox on the Run&quot; - by the Country GentlemenThen along came Alison Krauss, with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the Bluegrass community while she was still a teenager.She recorded several albums which were among the most well-received in the Bluegrass community leading up to 1995 when her label, Rounder, persuaded her to put together a few new recordings with mostly previous releases, some as &quot;guest star&quot; on other CDs to come up with the compilation &quot;Now That I\\'ve Found You&quot;(It may have been called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; for an artist that had HAD a &quot;hit&quot;).That CD stunned everyone, sold 6 million copies and suddenly Alison Krauss was the hottest female voice in Nashville - winning a handful of CMA awards.Under the expectations of THAT success Ms. Krauss and her band, Union Station, went to the studio to record the follow-up album.Many on either side of the &quot;Bluegrass Purist&quot; fence were expecting the next CD to be the &quot;Sell-Out&quot; CD - full of steel guitars and guest duets with Barbra Streisand.What came instead was THIS CD, &quot;So Long So Wrong&quot;, an album that celebrates the Bluegrass heritage that these musicians hail from in addition to showcasing the extraordinary contemporary talents of Alison and Union Station.Newcomers to Bluegrass expecting a recording with nothing but Alison\\'s voice were likely put out a little that some GUY was singing the lead vocal on several of these cuts.  Alison knew that Dan Tyminsky was an extraordinary vocalist YEARS before Dan was chosen to do the singing voiceover for George Clooney in &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot;The CD is one of the prominent ones that Alison jokes about in which her lead vocals are predominantly on beautiful but sorrowful ballads like &quot;Deeper Than Crying&quot; and &quot;Find My Way Back to my Heart.&quot;  These tracks are beautiful and they\\'re NOT &quot;straight bluegrass&quot; for you purists - Ron Block trades in his trusty 5-string for some tasty acoustic guitar work and these are closer to folk or even just &quot;unplugged pop&quot; than to bluegrass.  The Dan Tyminski tracks are rollicking rip-roaring bluegrass monsters like &quot;I\\'ll Remember You, Love in my Prayers&quot; and &quot;The Road is a Lover&quot;.This CD is one of the very best by Alison Krauss and Union Station, and that is saying something.  If you\\'re a fan of Alison, or maybe you just heard something about &quot;those musicians on the O Brother soundtrack&quot; this is a recording you just have to add to your collection.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Alison stays true to Her Artistic Vision\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1088035200, \"reviewTime\": \"06 24, 2004\"}\\n', '{\"reviewerID\": \"A2XV5LRO3DXNHO\", \"asin\": \"B0000002O5\", \"reviewerName\": \"mimisusu\", \"helpful\": [0, 0], \"reviewText\": \"Allison Krauss is truly talented.

Martin \\\\\"Darkbard\\\\\"\", \"helpful\": [3, 3], \"reviewText\": \"Bottom-Line: All and all \\\\\"So Long, So Wrong\\\\\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.Despite the fact that Alison Krauss hasn\\'t the vocal range of most in Country & Western/Blue Grass, she has managed to become the voice of the latter.  Her voice is lithe, but with a charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist; hence her success, mostly with her band Union Station.In 1995 the band Alison Krauss & Union Station (AKUS) released their seventh album \\\\\"So Long, So Wrong,\\\\\" which went on to garner critical acclaim, but not very much commercial success.  As is the band\\'s style they stayed away from the lavishly produced, pseudo-C&W; Pop that so marks other groups their adopted genre and instead remain fairly close to their Bluegrass roots.  But perhaps the CD was under-produced and engineered if there is such a malady.Most of the album\\'s vocal tracks were too quiet; i.e. it was hard to understand the lyrics throughout most of the CD especially when Ms. Krauss was taking lead.  The especially true on the CD\\'s title track, So Long, So Wrong (track No. 1), wherein Ms. Kruass\\'s already lithe voice is at points inaudible.  The same holds true for track No. 2 No Place To Hide, track No. 3 Deeper Than Crying, but to a lesser extent, track No. 4 I Can Let Go Now, track No. 5 The Road is a Lover, track No. 7 It Doesn\\'t Matter, well you get the picture.  The musicianship was flawless as usual, but the quiet vocal tracks detracted from my overall enjoyment of the CD.That is not to say the entire album is a throwaway because of the vocal shortcomings, far from it.  \\\\\"So Long, So Wrong\\\\\" maintains the bands tradition of fine musicianship and crisp clear harmonizing vocals (when they can be heard that is) and is overall a worthy AKUS release; just not my favorite.When Krauss isn\\'t spotlighted on center stage, her presence is still apparent in the guise of her high (soprano) harmonies and energetic fiddle.  Her ability to blend into the group, fade into the body as it were, only buttresses the sense that AKUS are indeed a band rather than merely a supporting backdrop for Krauss\\'s solo efforts.  An equaling male vocal cord is struck by guitarist and long time band member Dan Tyminski, who brings more traditional bluegrass sound to the group.  And Ron Block, who is not the strongest (solo) vocalists is an excellent song writer, and contributed two track to the album, track No. 11 Pain of a Troubled Mind (lead vocals) and track No. 14, the hauntingly beautiful There is a Reason.\\\\\"So Long, So Wrong\\\\\" is an ambitious CD; there are fourteen vocal tracks and one instrumental, track No. 6 Little Liza Jane.  When released the song were included on a two-album set, but only one CD.  All of the members of AKUS play instruments, indeed they are all considered virtuosos.  The circa 1997 group included Alison Krauss (vocals, fiddle, violin), Barry Bales (acoustic bass), Ron Block (banjo, guitar, vocals), Adam Steffey (mandolin), and Dan Tyminski (guitar, mandolin, vocals).  Adam Steffey has since left the group to be replaced by Jerry Douglas on the dobro.All and all \\\\\"So Long, So Wrong\\\\\" is a 3.5 star effort for AKUS because of the aforementioned vocal track issue.  The instrumentation on the CD is top notch and more than part of the reason I love this group so much; they have such a passion for Bluegrass and make this quintessential form of American music swell the soul.\", \"overall\": 3.0, \"summary\": \"Not One of My Favorite AKUS Albums, but Still Laudable\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1294531200, \"reviewTime\": \"01 9, 2011\"}\\n', '{\"reviewerID\": \"A1TOFOOLB07QXX\", \"asin\": \"B0000003S0\", \"reviewerName\": \"John W.

Buddy just laughed and said that he was the only real blues guitarist left, as everybody else was just in it for the money. He told the story of when he had followed Muddy Waters up to Chicago from Mississippi in the 50\\'s. Muddy Waters was broke and Buddy wanted to be just like him, in fact on his first meeting with his idol, he claimed that Muddy had saved his life, as if he hadn\\'t shared his dried salami &amp; cheese with him the young Buddy Guy would have starved to death.  For these of you wanting to hear some genuine `Blues\\' music, recorded in a modern studio with all the sound quality that this gives, this is the album for you. It was, unanimously, voted Blues album of the year by the Grammies in 1992. This album just reeks of class.  Buddy used his basic road band of long time bassist Greg Rzab on bass, Mick Weaver on keyboards and Richie Hayward on drums (temporarily borrowed from Little Feat). The group went to Battery studios with producer John Porter, who does a superb job keeping the sound clear and precise.  Several musicians stopped round during this period to pay their respects and add a lick here and a solo there. These people included the guitarists, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler, plus the Memphis Horns.  Strangely, one of the weaker moments on the album is \\\\\"Early In The Morning\\\\\" which has the Memphis Horns, Clapton &amp; Beck on it. It leaves the feeling that perhaps it was left on the album just to add to the star rating, not for it\\'s actual quality. The other low point on the album is a run through of Sir Mack Rice\\'s \\\\\"Mustang Sally\\\\\", a fine song but Buddy does little to distinguish his version from the 500 other cover versions.  The rest of the album though is pure golden Blues. The two long, slow Blues workouts are outstanding and allow Buddy to do what he does best, play his guitar. You get eight and a half minutes of the Eddie Boyd Classic \\\\\"Five Long Years\\\\\" and seven &amp; a half minutes of \\\\\"Black Night\\\\\" by Jesse Robinson. John Porter\\'s production leaves both of these songs stripped to the bone, and let the emotions drip from the guitar &amp; vocals. Spiritually these songs leave you exhausted, but nothing can prepare you for the albums final cut which is Buddy Guy\\'s tribute to his friend, Stevie Ray Vaughn. \\\\\"Remembering Stevie\\\\\" is an outstanding instrumental Blues song that literally sends shivers up and down your spine. Close your eyes and you can see Buddy playing with his eyes shut and the band giving sympathetic support, with Stevie looking down from high above.

Here is his number seven album \\\\\"Shorty The Pimp\\\\\", more of the Oakland sounding funk that he is known to put out with the help of his right hand producer Ant Banks, who produced the majority of this album...so you know it\\'s going to be good.Some tracks that immediately stood out to me were \\\\\"Hoes\\\\\" and \\\\\"No Love From Oakland\\\\\" two perfect sounding songs. The latter song, Short Dog spits two extremely long verses over a weird Banks beat. \\\\\"Step Daddy\\\\\" is a funny song about Short playing the role hooking up with a woman with kids. To me that is the best song on the album. \\\\\"Hoochie\\\\\" is another great song produced by D\\'Wayne Wiggins. The lead singles from this album were \\\\\"In The Trunk\\\\\" where Short spits one long verse, and \\\\\"I Want To Be Free (That\\'s The Truth)\\\\\" where he rhymes about how bad cops in Oakland are. For all you newcommers to Short, you\\'ll be suprised that he actually rhymed about something else more than sex. Near the end, Ant Banks, Pooh-Man, and Mhisani (Goldy) comes in for \\\\\"Something To Ride To\\\\\" where after they rhyme, the beat just plays for an additional six or seven minutes.Shorty The Pimp is an excellent album, especially if you\\'re a fan of Too Short. Some of the tracks sound dated, but never loose their replay value. Fans of Bay Area rap will like this one.

Kris enlisted the production of legend DJ Premier, who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius as a member of Gang Starr. The beats, however, while excellent, are quite simple, allowing KRS-One and his awesome character to take center stage. He drops some of the political and social stances of the last two BDP albums,EdutainmentandSex and Violence, in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach. That\\'s not to say that the verses aren\\'t relevant. His classic tales of police brutality, urban injustice, and hip hop loyalty are all here. He just delivers them in a way that puts the music and the performance to the forefront. This is a totally classic album. Every song is totally memorable, because KRS puts such a great performance on every track. Whether he\\'s screaming, singing, or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer, he entertains first and foremost. No track is even average or any worse than the others, this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album. I couldn\\'t find you any flaws, it\\'s arguably hip hop\\'s greatest MC teamed with arguably hip hop\\'s greatest producer. A must have for the rap fan.The album begins with an awesome intro, \\\\\"KRS-One Attacks,\\\\\" where Premo laces a totally dope beat and covers it with some old BDP samples, to make a perfect start. \\\\\"Outta Here\\\\\" uses simple drum-and-bass to allow KRS to address the current state of hip hop, chronicling his life as a rapper and talking about the tendency of rappers to \\\\\"fall off.\\\\\" Perhaps his best known song, \\\\\"Black Cop\\\\\" follows. Here, he is an entertainer first and an MC second, yelling and screaming, completely going wild on the mic. Anyone who hasn\\'t sang along to the yelps of \\\\\"Black coooop...black COP black COP black COP\\\\\" shouldn\\'t consider themself a hip hop fan. \\\\\"Mortal Thought\\\\\" is relevant, with a great chorus. I love the conceptually genius \\\\\"I Can\\'t Wake Up,\\\\\" where KRS raps from the perspective of a blunt. He namedrops most of the big names of \\'93 rap, as the MCs pass the blunt from rapper to rapper. Again, he yells and sings a great chorus, this song\\'s another classic. The nice \\\\\"Slap Them Up\\\\\" precedes the infamous \\\\\"Sound of da Police.\\\\\" The look at police brutalities is simply rap at its finest. My favorite part is where he draws a connection between the similar-sounding words \\\\\"overseer\\\\\" and \\\\\"officer\\\\\" in the second verse, as they both oppressed the urban black community. The chorus is just classic, nobody else could ever pull this off like KRS-One. \\\\\"Mad Crew\\\\\" has a heavily sampled beat, and \\\\\"Uh Oh\\\\\" uses a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine. \\\\\"Brown Skin Woman\\\\\" delivers musically and lyrically, and the following title track is just awesome. \\\\\"\\'P\\' Is Still Free\\\\\" is once again classic material, I remember first hearing this song on theMenace II Society: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcompilation. The album ends perfectly with \\\\\"Stop Frontin\\'\\\\\" and \\\\\"Higher Level,\\\\\" a provocative challenge to American religion with a heavy horn-laden beat.I feel like this album gets overlooked in comparison to the BDP albums, but I think this is as entertaining and enjoyable as anything KRS-One has ever done. A classic album in every sense of the word, perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre, 1993.

His eighth album is 1993\\'s \\\\\"Get In Where You Fit In,\\\\\" a fine showcase of one of rap\\'s most unique characters. Back in \\'93, classic hip hop LPs were dropping by the week, and Too Short\\'s Dangerous Crew created a presence with their funk-based Oakland sound. Ant Banks deserves a co-credit for this LP, for mastering the pure, ungangstafied funk that was the Dangerous Crew\\'s trademark. True to his formula, the songs have no hooks or recognizable structure, so sometimes they drag on, especially since all but two tracks approach six minutes or more. But the bass-heavy, twangy funk is endlessly enjoyable, with live instrumental breaks, clever samples, and thumping percussion. Banks\\' funk isn\\'t soulful or smooth like Long Beach\\'s g-funk; it\\'s heavy, deep, live, and tight. Musically this is one of Banks\\' best works, comparable to his solo efforts.It\\'s business as usual for Shorty on the mic. The topics at hand are pimping, his sexcapades, and prowess with the ladies. Short\\'s pimp persona is by this point familiar, but still fun as he tells long winding stories over Ant Banks\\' tracks. He is one-dimensional, but at this point in his career, the Dangerous Crew was in full effect, and frequent guests include Ant Banks, Goldy, Rappin\\' Ron, and Ant Diddley Dog. \\\\\"I\\'m a Player\\\\\" is the opening highlight, a pumping statement from both Short and Banks. \\\\\"Just Another Day,\\\\\" produced excellently by QDIII, chronicles a day that includes hustling in Oakland, a post-game party at Gary Payton\\'s house, and a concert in New Orleans. \\\\\"Gotta Get Some Lovin\\'\\\\\" recounts a \\\\\"dry spell\\\\\" over a spage-age banger, and Banks cleverly flips well-known samples for \\\\\"Money in the Ghetto\\\\\" and \\\\\"BJ Betty.\\\\\" Banks and Short trade off verses over \\\\\"All My Bs are Gone\\\\\"\\'s twangy lick, and the whole Dangerous Crew shows up for \\\\\"The Dangerous Crew\\\\\" and the title track, the latter a 9-minute diss at former member Pooh-Man (check outAin\\'t No Lovefor the comeback). Short proves time and time again that he can flow for days, and he is frequently a force on the mic as his stories defy any convention. Short and Banks are a great match and their music is completely unique and creative.\\\\\"Get In Where You Fit In\\\\\" isn\\'t a lyrical masterpiece by any means, but what Short lacks in lyricism he makes up for in style and Ant Banks\\' beats. It\\'s hard to compare an album like this to the classics of \\'93, because it relies on a different formula of music and style. In any event, it is a good listen that I recommend. Over Too Short\\'s long and winding career, his music has become reheated and derivative, but I think his best days were with Banks and the Dangerous Crew, so this is an album I\\'d check out if you\\'re new to Too Short. He\\'s a better character than rapper, but he\\'s one of rap\\'s most prolific and influential MCs and it\\'s hard to argue with this funk.

Released in 1993, 12 Play was where R. Kelly became a true R&B superstar. It was a concept album that showcased his talents and versatility perfectly. The opening track, \\\\\"Your Body\\'s Callin\\'\\\\\" is a classic. It\\'s a smooth and sexy ballad with airy instrumentation and the amazing vocals. \\\\\"Bump And Grind\\\\\" is another song that will go down as his most popular tune. The song has memorable bouncy beats and throbbing lyrics, that make this an instant classic. \\\\\"Homie, Lover, Friend\\\\\", \\\\\"Freak Dat Body\\\\\", and \\\\\"Back To The Hood Of Things\\\\\"; all show off his rapping skills with the G-Funk inspired beats and the awesome hooks. \\\\\"It Seems Like You\\'re Ready\\\\\" is a slow jam with R. setting the bar high on his romantic persona. \\\\\"I Like The Crotch On You\\\\\" is another one of Kelly\\'s X-rated themed songs with the G-Funk inspired rhythms, but after half of the song ends, he tones it down by singing with other male vocalists about the \\\\\"cons\\\\\" who hates his music. He also plays the piano on there. \\\\\"Summer Bunnies\\\\\" is an upbeat song about the ladies. \\\\\"For You\\\\\" is a personal favorite of mine. It\\'s a nice ballad with smoothed-out vocals, romantic spanish guitars, and the lushy strings. \\\\\"Sadie\\\\\" has R. doing a cover song of The Spinners\\' classic. He wonderfully dedicates the song to his mother. \\\\\"Sex Me\\\\\" is an 11-minute epic that has R. singing the most notorious lyrics of his career. It\\'s a well-crafted ballad with the airy synthesizers, bumpy drumming, and spacey vocals. The title track, \\\\\"12 Play\\\\\" is what I consider to be the climax of the whole album. It\\'s a lovely, slow jam with memorable hooks. Overall, all I can say about 12 Play is that it\\'s Kelly\\'s most raunchest and unified album, in every sense. His 2000 album, TP-2.Com, the sequel to this album, 12 Play, might\\'ve been more sexually explicit and thugged-out, but 12 Play just took him to a whole new level: bringing him to a mainstream audience and redefining his image.

Kelly is the man behind the music and he sings what he wants to, the new jack swing is mostly gone and the main theme is smooth midtempo\\'s with a theme about sex. infact it\\'s one of the most sexual albums since Prince.

It got effective beats and R. Kelly singing \\\\\"I Don\\'t See Nothing Wrong/ with a Little Bump N Grund\\\\\". \\\\\"Homie Lover Friend\\\\\" is a midtempo that features a rapper, the song sound taken from the early 90\\'s and resembles alot of songs from \\\\\"Born into the 90\\'s\\\\\". \\\\\"It Seems Like You\\'re Ready\\\\\" is another excellent number. It\\'s one of those seductive on the limit songs that could have been penned by Mr Marvin Gaye back in the day, R.

It\\'s delivered in 2 versions, together they are 10 minutes and resembles good old Prince music. \\\\\"12 Inch Play\\\\\" continues where Sex Me left off, odd that the title track is the last song? either way it\\'s a slow seductive song that closes a great album well.Overall, R. Kelly finally released a real solo album and he did it with great results. The album was a major hit and launched several hit singles as well. The theme is simple, S-E-X, but sex sells and it\\'s produced with first class. This album is much better then TP2 and TP3 and it was the album that made R. Kelly a superstar.

Taking it to the streets with all star support from 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 on \\\\\"Dusted \\'N\\' Disgusted\\\\\" as each shined with their signature flow.  Performed as a letter to a friend in jail \\\\\"1-Luv\\\\\" featuring Leviti poses the reality of simply living and E-40 did not miss a beat.  Relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smokers and drinkers, \\\\\"Smoke \\'N\\' Drank\\\\\", was written with just that in mind.  \\\\\"Dey Ain\\'t No\\\\\" is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this LP a more street feel.  Speaking about the street games, E-40 spits on how to invest into businesses for a legal hustle on \\\\\"Fed\\\\\" featuring Suga T.  Sharing verses with B-Legit & Celly Cel representing the \\\\\"H.I. Double L.\\\\\" side of Vallejo, California on how they live.  \\\\\"It\\'s All Bad\\\\\" is about life in the ghetto and changing times comparing it to excerpts found in the Bible.

E-40 is from Vallejo, and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next West Coast rap star.  His crazy, comical, hip style is a pleasure to listen to.  Also, the beats on this album are some of the best I\\'ve heard in a while.  They have a richness to them, which is real good.  Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely, Studio Tone (who produced some tracks for Kurupt), Funk Daddy, and a few others.  Also, E-40 raps extremely fast on some tracks, and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago.  However, after a listen, everything sounds clear as a bell!  He\\'s also got an amazing guest list: Tupac, Suga T, Mac Mall, Spice 1, B-Legit, Mac-Shawn, and Celly Cel to name a few.  But most of the tracks have E-40 going solo, which is good too, because it\\'s good to see he\\'s not just relying on others to guest on his album.  Overall the tracks sound &quot;Hipper than a hippopotamous&quot;.The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out &quot;The Bumble&quot;.  E-40 rips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas!  Definitely one of the most original beats I\\'ve heard in a while.  &quot;Sideways&quot; also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class.  Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on here too.  &quot;Spittin\\'&quot; has a heavy, sunny funk beat.  E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout.  &quot;Sprinkle Me&quot; is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-40\\'s sister) guests on it.  They make a nice sibling team.  Sprinkle me mayne!  &quot;Dusted And Disgusted&quot; like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut.  It features Tupac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.  The way the beat changes is so dope.  E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees.  Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat.  &quot;One Love&quot; is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal.  Great line: &quot;This ain\\'t no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious, more realistic than radio-shack&quot;.  Actually sounds like it could\\'ve been a huge hit even today.  &quot;Smoke And Drink&quot; has more of a Zapp sound to it.  E-40 raps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain!  &quot;They Ain\\'t Know&quot; is a slower song about street life and gettin\\' money.  The lyrics are worth listening to.  &quot;Fed&quot; has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-40 rips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it\\'s catchy.  &quot;H-i-Double-L&quot; is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40.  The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car.  &quot;Bootsee&quot; is a tight funky track about a busta named &quot;Bootsee&quot;.  I\\'m sure you\\'re familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they\\'re really just fakin\\' it.  &quot;It\\'s All Bad&quot; is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life.  He knows the game well.Overall if you like Bay Area rap, you probably have this, but if you don\\'t try it.  E-40 tears it up everytime he\\'s on the mic on this record, and the beats are amazing.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Sun-splashed Bay Area rap classic!

When you see who features on some of these tracks (Fat Joe, Channel Live, Das EFX and Mad Lion), you know that the album\\'s going to look forward to the future.KRS is one of hip-hop\\'s elder statesmen, having made his mark as frontman for Boogie Down Productions (&quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot;), with this album he registers two solo albums as well. As a result of his experience, he knows what he\\'s talking about - when he claims &quot;Rappers R N Dainja&quot; or &quot;MCs Act Like They Don\\'t Know&quot; he means it.Another feature of his vintage is that he comes from a time when MCs lived and died by the lyrics they recited, not by the catchiness of a hook or funk of a beat. Thus, he is able to preach his sociological messages while still making superb rhymes. If anyone doubts his sociological qualifications, he has done many lecture tours and (&quot;wrote over 1000 rhyme hooks/and sociological books/while you were worrying about your looks&quot;).One slight downside to KRS-ONE\\'s style is that the abrasive nature of his voice can sometimes get irritating, it\\'s a good thing then that he has brought in rappers with distinctive styles and voices to balance his. This practice does have its downside though, &quot;De Automatic&quot; is one of the stronger tracks on the album but the outro has the only appearance of Fat Joe repeating the words &quot;The south Bronx/The south south Bronx&quot;, which seems to interrupt the flow a bit. The same is slightly less true for &quot;Wannabemcees&quot; where Mad Lion\\'s distinctive toasting style only turns up in the outro (at least it is more grabbing than Fat Joe\\'s rap).The best tracks on the album would probably be &quot;Wannabemcees&quot;, &quot;De Automatic&quot; and &quot;Hold&quot; (in which KRS tells a story with one of the most amazing rhyme schemes ever recorded). Honorable mention would go to &quot;MCs Act Like They Don\\'t Know&quot; where, over a DJ Premier beat, KRS does a version of Kurtis Blow\\'s intro to &quot;The Breaks&quot; (&quot;Clap your hands everybody if you\\'ve got what it takes/Coz I\\'m KRS and I\\'m on the mike and Premier\\'s on the breaks&quot; as opposed to &quot;Clap your hands everybody if you\\'ve got what it takes/Coz I\\'m Kurtis Blow and I want you to know that these are the breaks&quot;).On the whole, KRS-ONE delivers another sterling performance, highlighted by amazing use of the mike and a great instinct to give the people what they want - straight up with a twist.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"The Master And His Pupils\", \"unixReviewTime\": 980121600, \"reviewTime\": \"01 22, 2001\"}\\n', '{\"reviewerID\": \"APEOO1ATR5VHB\", \"asin\": \"B00000052Y\", \"reviewerName\": \"Hype Currie \\\\\"scholar of pop culture\\\\\"\", \"helpful\": [1, 1], \"reviewText\": \"KRS-One (self titled)Released in the fall of 1995, KRS-One\\'s self-titled LP (technically his second solo effort) hit stores at a time when hip-hop was still dominated by the East/West rivalry of factions like Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records.

His 1995 sophomore effort \\\\\"Killa Kali\\\\\" is an excellent album of top-notch Bay Area hip hop. Celly\\'s not a lyrical visionary, but he\\'s an appealing rapper because he has style, a good flow and delivery, and a commanding presence on the mic. He raps about what he knows, and most of the time that consists of life in the Bay, hustling, and violence. He delivers good hooks and overall makes a nice performance. What sets \\\\\"Killa Kali\\\\\" apart from the sea of Bay Area albums from the mid-90s is the production. The music carries a distinctly Bay Area sound, with the choppy and bass-heavy beats and whiny instrumentals, but it is more melodic, smoother, and catchier than most of Celly\\'s brethren\\'s. The beats are funky and have a clean polish.\\\\\"Killa Kali\\\\\" is one of those albums that is so consistent, not much stands out. But that\\'s definitely a good thing; you\\'ll be hard-pressed to find any flaws in this well-executed LP. Celly is a likable rapper and the beats are awesome, among the best from the left coast in the fine year of \\'95. Guest appearances are strong, and unlike some of the weirder stuff that came from the Bay during this period, it has a wide appeal and rap fans of all types will enjoy the funky tracks.After the intro, Celly spits some menacing lyrics on the nice \\\\\"What U N...z Thought,\\\\\" and trades off verses with E-40 on the Bay Area thumper \\\\\"4 tha Scrilla.\\\\\" The single \\\\\"It\\'s Goin\\' Down\\\\\" is just an awesome track, boasting a perfect laidback g-funk beat with woozy electronic elements and a great performance from Celly, profiling a day in the life. \\\\\"Can\\'t Tell Me S...\\\\\" has some hard-hitting production, and \\\\\"Tha Bullet\\\\\" is a surprising concept track, with verses coming from the perspective of a gunshot bullet. My favorite song is the Spice 1 collaboration \\\\\"Red Rum,\\\\\" because the two MCs display such great chemistry. The production shines on \\\\\"Skanlezz Azz B...z\\\\\" and \\\\\"Remember Where You Came From,\\\\\" and the latter is a catchy track that supplies one of Celly\\'s better performances. The title track is a potent West Coast anthem on all fronts, while \\\\\"Playerizm\\\\\" is slow-rolling. The closer \\\\\"Funk Season\\\\\" is a highlight, with Celly showing a tight flow over a nice beat.\\\\\"Killa Kali\\\\\" isn\\'t revolutionary by any means, but Celly puts together a great album with tight beats and good performance. This is one of the very best LPs to emerge from the Bay Area explosion in the mid-90s, standing tall with the best albums from E-40, Spice 1, and the Young Black Brotha roster. \\'95 saw so many classic LPs that ones like this often get overlooked, but the tracks on \\\\\"Killa Kali\\\\\" have the spirit that made \\'95 such a great year for hip hop.

Kelly is that he can\\'t decide what he wants to be: his songs exude vibes of a sex maniac, a star-crossed lover, even a seriously religious devotee. And it\\'s that multiple-persona problem that makes his albums sound like a compilation more than an actual work.

memorable verse indeed over a bouncy bass-laden track.There are, of course, the syrupy-sweet ballads like &quot;Step In My Room&quot; and &quot;Love is On the Way,&quot; as well as the more R-rated songs like &quot;You Remind Me of Something,&quot; where R. croons &quot;You remind me of my Jeep/I wanna ride it/Something like my bank account/I wanna spend it.&quot; Words fail me.All in all, this
