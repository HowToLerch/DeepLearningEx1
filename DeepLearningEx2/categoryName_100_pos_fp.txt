I was listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and I liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere, so I checked out a few websites on Nick Drake. His tragic story kind of hooked me so I bought this CD. Quite frankly I find this to be interesting, but not something I would recomend to everybody. The mood of depression stays so heavy that every song sounds the same and makes me feel like I am watching one of those pulse readouts in a hospital room, and it is a flatliner. I suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of \"I wanna leave this world stuff\" but I get enough of it quick. Drake's guitar work was a bit unique in it's time, but as many times as I try, I just can't quite get with this program.
